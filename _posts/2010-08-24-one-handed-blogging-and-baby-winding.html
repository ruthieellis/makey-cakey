So baby Martha is here and has turned our world upside down - but in a beautiful, cuddly, wonderful sort of way (admittedly with frequent bouts of crying, sicking and pooing!). She's currently asleep on my shoulder, so this will be a quick post, due to the one handed typing... but I thought I should post a couple of pics before I forget...<br />The first is of a fab Chard, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Emmental</span> and Brazil Nut Quiche I made about a month before M arrived. No recipe because I made it up, and it was so long ago I've completely forgotten the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">ingredients</span> and quantities. But it was absolutely delicious, so I'll have to try to recreate it at some point in the future!<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TIAhsmCj7dI/AAAAAAAAAPw/OdFRVNtKq3w/s1600/DSC00094.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TIAhsmCj7dI/AAAAAAAAAPw/OdFRVNtKq3w/s320/DSC00094.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5512442993910738386" border="0" /></a><br />And on the 20<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">th</span> of Aug it was my better half's birthday. With a teeny baby, I was lacking both the time and energy for a proper birthday cake, but thanks to a fab <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">TK</span>-<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Maxx</span> biscuit cutter find, I did manage to rustle up a Giant Dinosaur Jigsaw Cookie - again no recipe - just a standard-type biscuit mix, baked at a relatively low temp to prevent it spreading too much.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TIAhtHWZ0zI/AAAAAAAAAP4/-DmqgJ1Erd4/s1600/DSC00126.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TIAhtHWZ0zI/AAAAAAAAAP4/-DmqgJ1Erd4/s320/DSC00126.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5512443002852332338" border="0" /></a><br />Here's hoping that I'll have time for a but more making, caking and blogging in the not too distant future :o)
