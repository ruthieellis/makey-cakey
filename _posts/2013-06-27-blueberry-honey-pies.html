After reading the title of this post - Blueberry Honey Pies - I can't help thinking that it sounds like the name of a Carebear, or My Little Pony, however it is in fact my Daring Bakers' June challenge submission, and what we had for pudding tonight.<br /><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DNrDMPrQJ60/Ucy2jjq3RtI/AAAAAAAAGEI/tyxg2Azqtv8/s1600/DSC00621.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DNrDMPrQJ60/Ucy2jjq3RtI/AAAAAAAAGEI/tyxg2Azqtv8/s400/DSC00621.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /></div><div>Rachael from <a href="http://pizzarossa.wordpress.com/">pizzarossa</a> was our lovely <a href="http://www.thedaringkitchen.com/">June 2013 Daring Bakers</a>' host and she had us whipping up delicious pies in our kitchens! Cream pies, fruit pies, chocolate pies, even crack pies! There's nothing like pie!</div><div><br /></div><div>That's not a typo above, there really is such a thing as crack pie, that is entirely legal (although also entirely unhealthy). It's an oatmeal cookie crust, filled with a gooey sweet fudgy chewy filling - and also really really really full of dairy things (like butter, more butter, powdered milk and whipping cream). Whilst I do like to pick up the de-dairification gauntlet, that seemed a bit beyond me. Plus there's something decadent about eating lots of butter, which just doesn't work with soya margarine!</div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dfPA4_D_ORM/Ucy2ZoWFK1I/AAAAAAAAGD4/-Iw0QWfLDp0/s1600/DSC00618.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dfPA4_D_ORM/Ucy2ZoWFK1I/AAAAAAAAGD4/-Iw0QWfLDp0/s400/DSC00618.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /></div><div>The other challenge recipes suggested to us were a crostata (an Italian pie filled with fruit preserve), chocolate caramel pie (again, difficult to de-dairy) and a traditional double crust apple pie.</div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Dwtrbi5XRBU/Ucy2dp3c81I/AAAAAAAAGEA/jrWRRMbZGFM/s1600/DSC00620.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Dwtrbi5XRBU/Ucy2dp3c81I/AAAAAAAAGEA/jrWRRMbZGFM/s400/DSC00620.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /></div><div>I ended up making what is probably closer to the progeny of a union between said crostata and double crust apple pie: little double crust pies filled with blueberry preserves and honey.</div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qMYq4UQQtc4/Ucy2wKBQTGI/AAAAAAAAGEY/5ISpb3HFxh4/s1600/DSC00630.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qMYq4UQQtc4/Ucy2wKBQTGI/AAAAAAAAGEY/5ISpb3HFxh4/s400/DSC00630.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /></div><div>I made an olive oil pastry, which I always find turns out slightly tougher than a butter pastry, but very quick and easy to make. I used <a href="http://www.thefirstmess.com/2013/05/15/little-vegan-chocolate-tarts-spelt-olive-oil-pastry-recip/">this recipe from The First Mess</a>, which other than substituting the spelt flours for regular white plain flour, I followed fairly closely. It uses extra virgin olive oil, but the taste isn't overpowering, and I would hazard a guess that the 'extra virgin' bit isn't critical - most oils should work, although some might impart more or less flavour and sophistication than others...&nbsp;</div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4Jl67I2Z1Vc/Ucy2GBWwunI/AAAAAAAAGDw/kmKvIP_TQ0A/s1600/DSC00616.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4Jl67I2Z1Vc/Ucy2GBWwunI/AAAAAAAAGDw/kmKvIP_TQ0A/s400/DSC00616.jpg" width="265" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uyaqyQR2EJo/Ucy2FafDqdI/AAAAAAAAGDo/h-1TRv2b90s/s1600/DSC00617.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uyaqyQR2EJo/Ucy2FafDqdI/AAAAAAAAGDo/h-1TRv2b90s/s400/DSC00617.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /></div><div>For the filling, I mixed together some lovely blueberry preserve we were given as a gift (about 1/3 of a jar) and a heaped teaspoon of honey. Not any honey, <a href="http://www.colonsay.org.uk/LocalProduce/Oysters-and-Honey">Colonsay Wildflower Honey</a> which we brought back from our summer travels last year and have been carefully rationing! It's gorgeous stuff - and made by very lovely happy bees - Mr E survived 3 days of a hands-on beekeeping course with the Colonsay bees and emerged un-stung which is a testament to their good nature.<br /><br />The blueberry and honey flavour combination was delicious - and the pastry recipe is a keeper - one even survived the journey to work unscathed, to be rather unglamorously photographed at coffee time - cling film, dusty keyboard and all!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FH2ozjKp-aY/Ucy171fpeuI/AAAAAAAAGDg/U8KQt1DwJns/s1600/2013-06-27+09.32.37.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FH2ozjKp-aY/Ucy171fpeuI/AAAAAAAAGDg/U8KQt1DwJns/s320/2013-06-27+09.32.37.jpg" width="320" /></a></div></div>
