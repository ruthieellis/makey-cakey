Crazy plant. This photo makes it look like it is growing towards the light (assuming you know our living room layout...) but in fact that's just because I turned it around to try to even it out. In fact, it seemed to be choosing to grow very very quickly (as in 2 cm overnight) away from the light. We seem to have been given some sort of alien triffid!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-08-09-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-08-09-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />
