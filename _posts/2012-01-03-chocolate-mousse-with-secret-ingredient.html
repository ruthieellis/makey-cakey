Chocolate mousse is delicious - a fact that is pretty much universally accepted.<div>Dairy free chocolate mousse that doesn't taste of soya is pretty hard to find - also a fact.</div><div>Therefore I'd have been keen to make this no matter how complicated the recipe looked.</div><div>But in actual fact it is ridiculously simple! I found the recipe here - <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-01-03ca1196f3-large-image-0000.html">Vegan Avocado Chocolate Mousse</a>.</div><div>Avocado. In chocolate mousse. I have to confess I was initially unconvinced. But just think of it as fortuitous that I've done the sceptical bit for you - and you can now just take my word for it that it doesn't taste of avocado, just rich, yummy, chocolate mousse!</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-01-03789612b8-large-image-0001.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-01-03-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div></div><div><br /></div><div><b>Dairy Free Chocolate Mousse</b> (serves 2)</div><div>1 small-medium ripe avocado</div><div>1/2 a cup of cocoa powder</div><div>1/2 a cup of agave syrup</div><div>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</div><div><br /></div><div>Put all of the ingredients in a jug or liquidiser. Blend until smooth. If it's too stiff, you can loosen it up with a splash of non-dairy milk (if you don't want to use soya, I'd recommend oat milk).</div><div><br /></div><div>Unlike other avocado dishes, it seems to keep well in the fridge, and was just as delicious the next day and all of the chocolateyness means that for once you don't need to worry about the avocado discolouring, which is a bonus. If you need it to be dairy free for yourself or guests, just make sure your cocoa powder doesn't have any added milk in it - it's cocoa rather than drinking chocolate that you need. And finally, make sure your avocado is very ripe - if it's still hard it will be difficult to blend and you'll be left with tiny avocado pieces in your mousse, which will stop the texture being as smooth as it should be.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></div><div>And as a parting thought, I guess with the avocado included, and agave rather than refined sugar, this could almost be classed as healthy... depending on how rose tinted your spectacles are. According to the NHS, half an avocado counts as one of your five a day!</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-01-0335d56d47-large-image-0002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-01-03-image-0001.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div></div>
