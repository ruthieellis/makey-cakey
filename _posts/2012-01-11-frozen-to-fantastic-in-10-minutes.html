Mini-M is enjoying soup at the moment. And dipping things in it. She's a fan of dipping pretty much anything, into anything else, if I'm being honest. Tonight, at dinner time, she dipped cucumber into vanilla soya custard and seemed to enjoy it. Maybe it is an undiscovered delicious taste sensation, but I have to confess I didn't try it!<br /><br />So I decided to make soup, took a look in the fridge, and found that the only soup-y ingredients I had were an onion, and some sad looking herbs that I discounted at the outset. I'm quite glad there was nothing else, and I had to resort to the freezer, because the resulting Pea soup was lovely. And ready in 10 minutes. Fast, tasty, healthy and warm - all good things for a January recipe.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fYY8dtUXMCM/Tw327TC4FUI/AAAAAAAACP8/surgM67Fd4M/s1600/10012012128.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fYY8dtUXMCM/Tw327TC4FUI/AAAAAAAACP8/surgM67Fd4M/s400/10012012128.JPG" width="225" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Why yes, we do use our Christmas mugs in January - and all year round for that matter.
