<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Quite a few years back, I remember our family having Delia's chocolate truffle torte one Christmas, specifically because, since I lived in the 'big city' at uni, I was asked to find some amaretti biscuits that were clearly proving elusive in deepest darkest Hawick! I still remember finding a deli that stocked about six different types, and having no idea what quantity they were required in, so buying about four packets.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-URRIkPF2SsQ/TukQ0UQ5I4I/AAAAAAAACGI/U07k_1M-Jvc/s1600/101_1117.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-12-14-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Anyway, it was a decadent, rich, chocolatey concoction, and buoyed up by the success of my dairy free chocolate truffles, I began to ponder if it could be made dairy free by using coconut milk instead of the cream, and dairy free dark chocolate.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This post is proof that it can! I made it for a weekend away with friends and it got a whole hearted thumbs up, as well as general disbelief that it was dairy free, which is always a good thing. Substitutes that taste like substitutes always make me a bit sad - I want things to taste fantastic in their own dairy-free right.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I'm just gutted I didn't manage to take some better pictures of its fantastic-ness!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Coconut Chocolate Truffle Torte</b> (serves 10-12)</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div><ul><li>75g dessicated coconut</li><li>450g dark chocolate (high cocoa solids, dairy free)</li><li>5 tbsp liquid glucose</li><li>5 tbsp cherry brandy</li><li>2x 400ml tins coconut milk</li></ul><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This recipe has an unusual first step... about a week before you want to make the torte, put your coconut milk in your fridge. Shove it to the back, and go away and forget about it.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">When you're ready to make the torte (and remember it needs to chill overnight before serving) toast the coconut in a dry frying pan over a low heat, or under a grill until lightly browned.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Grease and line a 8-10 inch loose bottomed cake tin (line the sides as well as the base, since you don't want it to taste 'greased').</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Sprinkle the toasted coconut over the base of the tin.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Break the chocolate into pieces and add to a heat proof bowl with the liquid glucose and cherry brandy.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Heat it over a pan of gently simmering water until melted and completely smooth.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Take your tins of coconut milk out of the fridge, and don't shake them or turn them upside down. Remove the lids and carefully spoon out all of the thick coconut cream. By chilling it, it will have separated into a thick creamy layer on the top, with a smaller layer of very watery coconut milk at the bottom.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Once you've spooned out all of the thick stuff, give it a quick whisk with an electric beater to thicken it a little more.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Add the cooled chocolate mixture and mix gently to combine, then pour over the coconut into the prepared tin.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Give it a shoogle to settle the top level and tap it off the worktop a few times so that the bubbles rise to the top.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Chill it overnight in the fridge.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">To serve, tip it out of the tin onto a serving plate - worry not, it is pretty robust! Carefully peel off the greaseproof paper, and there you go. Rich dark chocolate coconut creamy goodness with a subtle hit of alcohol - a perfect grown up pudding!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dur7EpZcYBc/TukQ5Ut2yWI/AAAAAAAACGQ/nISMvArN6Ao/s1600/101_1118.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-12-14-image-0001.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br />
