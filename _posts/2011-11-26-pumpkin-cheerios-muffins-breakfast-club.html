The <a href="http://notjustanyoldbaking.blogspot.com/2011/10/breakfast-club-16-stars-and-stripes.html">November Breakfast Club</a> challenge was hosted by <a href="http://notjustanyoldbaking.blogspot.com/">Susan at A Little Bit of Heaven on a Plate</a>. I have just discovered whilst writing this post, that through my own stupidity, I completely missed the posting deadline, over a week ago. Oops. Doubly frustrating since I actually made them in very good time. Since I made them in time, I'm posting this anyway - better late than never, as they say...<br /><div><br /></div><div>The theme was 'Stars and Stripes' meaning anything with an American twist was fair game.</div><div><br /></div><div>I decided to go down the muffin route, and went for an double American combination - Cheerios and pumpkin.</div><div><br /></div><div>I found a recipe for <a href="http://www.mrbreakfast.com/display.asp?categoryid=1&amp;subcategoryid=9&amp;recipeid=1186">Cheerios Muffins at Mr Breakfast</a>, and decided to substitute the applesauce for pumpkin puree, and the milk for almond milk to make them dairy free.</div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0Rx7NXN3cdk/TtFQKp2fymI/AAAAAAAAB64/V3n6A1p5nrg/s1600/101_0890.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0Rx7NXN3cdk/TtFQKp2fymI/AAAAAAAAB64/V3n6A1p5nrg/s320/101_0890.JPG" width="240" /></a></div><br /><br /></div><div>Unfortunately it was only after I poured the batter into the tins, thinking that it didn't look quite right, that I read back and noticed instruction step one, which I had overlooked the first time...</div><div><br /></div><div>"Crush the Cheerios into very small pieces". Oops again! I put them in whole, which meant that they didn't bulk out the mixture like they should have, and instead just went kind of oddly chewy!</div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7u_A88RVcpI/TtFP_NpQRnI/AAAAAAAAB6g/6Q_Zrf_PBLM/s1600/101_0885.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7u_A88RVcpI/TtFP_NpQRnI/AAAAAAAAB6g/6Q_Zrf_PBLM/s320/101_0885.JPG" width="240" /></a></div><br /><br /></div><div>The muffins were still nice, just a little denser and flatter than the should have been. The pumpkin flavour came through well, and made them even feel a little healthier than eating regular muffins - cake with hidden vegetables in it is always a win!</div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Insf0QQj9ak/TtFQDohRntI/AAAAAAAAB6o/qsbbksv4iiU/s1600/101_0886.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Insf0QQj9ak/TtFQDohRntI/AAAAAAAAB6o/qsbbksv4iiU/s320/101_0886.JPG" width="240" /></a></div><br />Next month, whatever the challenge is, I'll be making extra sure I read the recipe instructions thoroughly before I get stuck in though!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://fussfreeflavours.com/breakfast-club/"><img border="0" src="http://fussfreeflavours.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Breakfast-Club-logo.gif" /></a></div></div>
