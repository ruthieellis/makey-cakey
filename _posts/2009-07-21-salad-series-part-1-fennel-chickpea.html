We had folks round for tea on Sunday, and I made 7 salads and a puff pastry tart.... of which I managed to take a grand total of 3 pictures, all of 'in-progress' salads. So it's not really caking or making in the original way I intended my blog to be, centering around baking and crafts, but it's kinda take or leave it, since I've nothing else to post at the moment!<br /><br />I decided it was a good opportunity to try out some recipes that have been lurking in my Safari bookmarks folder for a while, but as usual, my desire to experiment coupled with a lack of the right ingredients despite 3 trips to the supermarket over the weekend meant the end results bore no resemblance to what I was originally inspired by, nonetheless, they seemed to go down well, so I'm documenting the recipes here for future recreation or corruption by others!<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fennel, Chickpea &amp; Chili Salad (serves 8ish)</span><br /></div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SmYnRIuuz_I/AAAAAAAAAME/QObnJHjVL9g/s1600-h/100_2968.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2009-07-21-image-0000.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5361015581785903090" border="0" /></a><br /><ul><li>1 head of fennel thinly sliced</li><li>1 spring onion finely chopped</li><li>1 red chili, de-seeded and finely chopped/minced</li><li>1 400g tin of chickpeas, rinsed and drained</li><li>1 300g tin of green lentils, rinsed and drained</li><li>1 tbsp chopped parsley</li><li>1 tbsp chopped basil</li><li>Fennel fronds chopped if your fennel came with them attached</li><li>Juice of 2 fresh lemons</li><li>3 tbsp olive oil</li><li>3 tbsp grated fresh Parmesan</li></ul>I used a mandolin to slice my fennel which got it really nice and fine, although it always scares me a bit using it! The fennel, chickpeas, lentils, spring onion, chili, parsley, basil, &amp; fennel fronds all went into a big mixing bowl. I whisked up the lemon juice and olive oil, then poured it over, mixed well and left to marinate in the fridge for a few hours. Just before serving I mixed through the Parmesan cheese. It tasted good on the day it was made, and even better leftover for lunch the next day!
