This is a no-frills post!<br />Recipe with very little chat, since I've got a BIG backlog of photos and scraps of paper with ingredients written on them. Some have no titles, and ingredients jotted down so incoherently that not even I, as the writer, have any idea what the recipes were actually for. This one, however was recorded neatly and legibly (in gold glittery pen no less, on the back of a receipt - I'm not proud - I'll use the first think I can lay my hand to!)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jdNQfCk7oF0/UpPLnF777UI/AAAAAAAAHKw/Z_nkObDug30/s1600/DSC02079.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jdNQfCk7oF0/UpPLnF777UI/AAAAAAAAHKw/Z_nkObDug30/s400/DSC02079.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>Giant Uber Cookie</b> (Cuts into 8-10 pieces)<br /><br /><ul><li>300g SR flour</li><li>150g dairy free margarine</li><li>150g granulated sugar</li><li>1 egg</li><li>4 tbsp Oatly oat milk (other types of milk would also work perfectly)</li><li>80g filling - I used a raw chocolate peanut butter, but most jams or spreads would be delicious</li></ul><br />Preheat the oven to 180C (160C fan) and grease a flat baking sheet (or line with a non-stick liner).<br />Sift the flour into a bowl, then rub in the margarine.<br />Stir in the sugar.<br />Beat the egg and oat milk together.<br />Stir until combined - you are looking for a sticky dough - you may need to add a little splash of extra milk.<br />Half the dough mixture and grease your hands with a little oil, then take half of the mixture and squash it out onto the baking sheet into approximately an 8-9 inch circle.<br />Spread the nut butter over the dough, leaving a gap of approximately and inch around the edges.<br />Oil your hands again, and on a piece of parchment squash the other piece of dough into a similarly sized circle (the dough is too wet to properly roll out), then carefully place it ontop of the base.<br />Give it a token press around the edges to seal.<br />Bake for around 25 minutes until golden on top.<br />Allow to cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes at least before eating - particularly if you've chosen jam as your filling: much as warm baking is delicious, jam burns are not!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GAkjsBFOLbo/UpPLnyJavdI/AAAAAAAAHK0/8NV-vAZ5XDs/s1600/DSC02082.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GAkjsBFOLbo/UpPLnyJavdI/AAAAAAAAHK0/8NV-vAZ5XDs/s400/DSC02082.JPG" width="400" /></a></div>
