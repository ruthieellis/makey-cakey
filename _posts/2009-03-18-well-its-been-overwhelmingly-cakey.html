Well it's been overwhelmingly cakey things that I've been posted about so far. That will change soon, once my latest craft experiment is finished - almost there and I think it's fab! But in the meantime, here's another cake - it's been a bit of a baking frenzy recently....<br /><div>I did this one for Comic Relief - it was the prize of a quiz held at work organised by a colleauge of mine, and raised just over Â£85 not to shabby :o)</div><div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/ScFQky2csBI/AAAAAAAAAIU/abbWQrsHnv0/s1600-h/100_2432.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5314617628329553938" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/ScFQky2csBI/AAAAAAAAAIU/abbWQrsHnv0/s400/100_2432.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; height: 300px; width: 400px;" /></a></div><div>Inside it was a toffee cake with a layer of chocolate fudge icing in the middle - yum!</div>
