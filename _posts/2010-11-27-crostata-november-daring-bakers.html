Can't believe it's Daring Bakers' posting time again - it's flown by with crazy speed and donuts seem a distant memory...<br /><br />The 2010 November Daring Bakers’ challenge was hosted by Simona of <a href="http://briciole.typepad.com/">briciole</a>. She chose to challenge Daring Bakers’ to make pasta frolla for a crostata. She used her own experience as a source, as well as information from Pellegrino Artusi’s Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well.<br /><br />I'm eating dairy free at the moment, so mine were made with olive oil margarine instead of butter, and filled with a spiced apple, blackberry, pear and plum compote and drizzled with very dark chocolate for that all important puddingy hit!<br /><br />The pastry held up better than I thought it would, and the stars didn't sink like I feared, so all in all a success even with the modifications - woop!<br /><div style="text-align: center;">Before...<br /></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TPFIDM949QI/AAAAAAAAARg/ZTBeLGkF6mc/s1600/100_5307.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010-11-27-image-0000.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5544291836127409410" border="0" /></a><br />... and after<br /></div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TPFIDbQXlwI/AAAAAAAAARo/K5XwimsaDso/s1600/100_5318.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010-11-27-image-0001.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5544291839963010818" border="0" /></a>
