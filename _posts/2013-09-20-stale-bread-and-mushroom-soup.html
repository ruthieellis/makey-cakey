Stale Bread Soup. Doesn't sound very appealing, but tastes lovely when you add mushrooms, sweetcorn and onion into the mix.<br /><br />It tastes like a Pot Noodle - but in a good way - the momentary niceness of a pot noodle before all the weird stuff makes your mouth/insides go funny. I think it's probably the creamy mushroom and sweetcorn combo doing its delicious thing.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GLwOtmPj7sY/Ujy069Qi0wI/AAAAAAAAGt8/ME0wNVCu0n4/s1600/2013-09-18+17.26.31.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GLwOtmPj7sY/Ujy069Qi0wI/AAAAAAAAGt8/ME0wNVCu0n4/s400/2013-09-18+17.26.31.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Tasty - but not so pretty</td></tr></tbody></table>And it's also creamy - but still dairy free - magic! The magic of oat milk.<br /><br />As an aside, Mini-M is into magic at the moment - she thinks she is a bit of a magician - her latest superpower is being able to use the electric windows in the car - she's not yet realised that actually Mr E has control over them... She's also a fan of magically making things disappear by either a) dropping them on the flood behind her back, or b) flinging them very very unsubtly off to stage left. And there's a magic word to pass her at the top of the stairs on the way to bedtime. We have to guess. The other night it was apparently 'Towel Carpet Budgie' - it can be a lengthy process sometimes!<br /><br />Back to the soup...<br />I'm submitting this for the September <a href="http://www.tinnedtomatoes.com/p/no-croutons-required.html#.UjytpBYgG5c">No Croutons Required</a> challenge hosted by <a href="http://www.tinnedtomatoes.com/">Tinned Tomatoes</a>, which is to create a veggie soup or salad using <a href="http://foodandspice.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/no-croutons-required-winner-for-august.html">Mushrooms</a>. Job done.<br /><br /><b>Creamy Mushroom Soup</b> (Serves 4 as a main meal or 6 as a starter)<br /><br /><ul><li>4 slices of stale wholemeal bread (I used Polish wheat &amp; rye sourdough)</li><li>2 small onions</li><li>1 tbsp olive oil</li><li>350g mushrooms</li><li>1 corn cob</li><li>500ml oat milk</li><li>500ml water</li><li>1 veggie stock cube</li><li>salt and pepper</li></ul><br />Heat the oil in a large saucepan.<br />Chop the onion and sautee for a few minutes.<br />Meanwhile cut the mushrooms into chunks, strip the kernels off the corn cob with a sharp knife, and tear the bread into pieces.<br />Add the mushrooms to the onions and cook for a few minutes more, then add the oat milk, bread, water and stock.<br />Simmer for about 15 mins, then take off the heat and blend until smooth.<br />Return to the pan, add the corn kernels and simmer for another 5 mins.<br />Season to taste and serve<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tue6f93KgAI/Ujy07O7agVI/AAAAAAAAGuA/fpXXglmwrl0/s1600/2013-09-18+17.26.05.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tue6f93KgAI/Ujy07O7agVI/AAAAAAAAGuA/fpXXglmwrl0/s400/2013-09-18+17.26.05.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Soup to match the current weather - a bit murky!</td></tr></tbody></table>This is definitely the most convincingly creamy non-dairy creamy soup I've tried. It doesn't have that weird soya milk taste, and also doesn't taste like porridge (just in case you were wondering!).<br /><br />And it's ready in half and hour, and uses up stale bread (sorry ducks...) - a winning combo.<br /><br />As such, I'm also going to submit it to the <a href="http://www.turquoiselemons.com/no-waste-food-challenge.html">No Waste Food Challenge</a>, masterminded by <a href="http://www.turquoiselemons.com/index.html">Turquoise Lemons</a> and hosted this month by <a href="http://www.elizabethskitchendiary.co.uk/2013/08/no-waste-food-challenge-anything-goes.html">Elizabeth's Kitchen Diary</a>. And let's face it - soup that delivers a little bit of the moral high ground, as well as being hearty and warming is even tastier.<br /><br />
