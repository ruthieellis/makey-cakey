Running an imaginary cafe/campsite in the play area of the Polish shop. Good job, since the queues were epic! Mini-M provided a fair amount of entertainment to numerous small Polish kids, who seemed to be taking it turns to be dared to speak to her, but bottling out at the last minute, and instead just running up, standing a little distance away (or indeed behind her) and smiling! I think Scottish kids might be a bit of an unusual occurrence there...<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-12-21-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-12-21-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div>
