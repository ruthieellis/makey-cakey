This month's <a href="http://fussfreeflavours.com/breakfast-club/">Breakfast Club</a>, organised by Helen from <a href="http://fussfreeflavours.com/">Fuss Free Flavours</a>, is hosted by <a href="http://utterlyscrummy.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/breakfast-club-sweet-treats-pastries.html">Utterly Scrummy Food For Families</a> who has asked us to cook up a delicious Breakfast Pastry or Sweet Treat.<br /><br />I went for a quick and easy recipe that definitely gave us a sweet Saturday morning breakfast treat: Coconut Toast.<br /><br />I used a recipe I found at <a href="http://www.tasteofhome.com/Recipes/Coconut-Toast">Taste of Home</a> which I halved, subbed the butter for dairy-free margarine, and generally tweaked the quantities a little bit.<br /><br />So here's my recipe adaptation...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-opK38W8FTGg/T4xukQRT7SI/AAAAAAAAC1A/vtcObKvEYMw/s1600/100_1933.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-opK38W8FTGg/T4xukQRT7SI/AAAAAAAAC1A/vtcObKvEYMw/s400/100_1933.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><b>Coconut Toast</b> (makes enough for 4 slices with some extra topping which will keep in the fridge for another day)<br /><br /><ul><li>4 slices bread - I used Polish sourdough</li><li>1/2 cup unsweetened desiccated coconut</li><li>1/2 cup sugar</li><li>2 tbsp dairy free margarine, melted</li><li>1 egg beaten</li><li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li></ul><br />Preheat the oven to 180C and very lightly grease a baking sheet.<br />Lay out the slices of bread on the baking sheet.<br />Mix together all of the ingredients, then spread onto the bread.<br />You want a layer that isn't too thick, otherwise it won't cook properly, but not too thin either!<br />Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden on top.<br />Lift onto a cooling rack, and allow to cool for about 5 minutes before eating to avoid burning your mouth!<br /><br />This was lovely - and probably once you analyse it, not that much more unhealthy than toast with jam.<br />It was easy to make, which is important for breakfast, quick - another must, and of course tasty!<br />You could easily add a lot of other flavours to this - cinnamon would be lovely, some chopped nuts also fantastic - it seems a very flexible recipe.
