Coconut Yogurt (unbelievably good!) by <a href="http://www.coyo.co.uk/">CoYo</a>, drizzled with honey, and chopped nuts.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SXMq8MHv_ZM/T34P7FKBoaI/AAAAAAAACqg/u7INnK8CUOM/s1600/30032012303.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-04-05-image-0000.JPG" width="225" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>Amazing.<br /><br />However I am going to have to take out a bank loan to pay for it, as coconut yogurt is not cheap! Delicious though. Very. Thick, creamy and yummy. And no weird soya taste - even bigger win :o)<br /><br />I have justified it to myself by concluding that my annual yogurt bill so far over the past 18 months has been virtually nil, so a tub of coconutty goodness here or there, when calculated as a price per day, is still less than Mr E's regular yogurt bill. No loss of moral high ground - phew.
