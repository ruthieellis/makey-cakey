It's hard to believe that this is my last daily photo roundup post. I've gone a whole year taking a picture every day, and looking back, I think I've managed it on about 355/365 days. I make that a 97% success rate, which I'm pretty sure is better than I've ever done on any exam!<br /><br />It's been really fun and interesting to do - the camera has become part of my day to day handbag equipment (along with a squashed cereal bar, quite a lot of crumbs, some stale chewing gum, a ponytail band despite having very short hair - you know - the essentials!). Mini-M now picks it up, and says 'cheese' (which admittedly sounds more like 'chszzzz' with no vowels at all), when she wants her picture taken. I've created a 1 year old photo diva!<br /><br />It's also my 200th blog post! Since starting in January 2009, it took me 30 months until July 2011 to reach 100 posts, then 6 months to notch up my second century. I'm feeling quite proud of my little blog!<br /><br />Anyway, Mr E is going to be taking over the daily photo mantle, and I guess we'll soon discover how, when and where the pictures are going to be posted!<br /><br />But until then, for the final time, here are last week's photos...<br /><br /><b>Saturday 24th December</b><br />Christmas Eve finished with a quiet game of Scrabble after a lovely family gathering over the Forth in Fife. Mini-M slept, and Mr E and I put our feet up and pondered double word scores, triple letter scores and whether or not any words contained no vowels...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HMtYNxae-1c/Tv-HTC6ilAI/AAAAAAAACLo/cru7_i-hxyI/s1600/100_0140.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-12-31-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Sunday 25th December</b><br />We went to the zoo on Christmas Day. The penguins were the highlight. Mini-M has been working on her penguin wiggle, and it was performed at many times throughout the day!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IwdVSS6NT3U/Tv-HZzm0xtI/AAAAAAAACLw/3DF_SaiMMC8/s1600/100_0189.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-12-31-image-0001.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Monday 26th December</b><br />Boxing Day saw us head to Granny and Grandad E's, where Mini-M continued the penguin theme by wearing her penguin jumper around her waist and waddling around the kitchen, with a cushion.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4HzCLSh9-rg/Tv-HgX1tFcI/AAAAAAAACL4/AD8IvKOTLJI/s1600/100_0218.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-12-31-image-0002.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Tuesday 27th December</b><br />A trip to Harestanes for some fresh air and see-sawing got everyone out of the house.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ilYsnvwDDD8/Tv-HmKBQ_8I/AAAAAAAACMA/Tt3a6WStRug/s1600/100_0227.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-12-31-image-0003.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Wednesday 28th December</b><br />In a rain-free gap there was some technical swing construction...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lr-w3sHofUQ/Tv-HuebhDLI/AAAAAAAACMI/nJWm8ZM6J6s/s1600/100_0234.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-12-31-image-0004.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Thursday 29th December</b><br />Indulging in some holiday reading...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3qaqcqjIXZE/Tv-H4c2Ym1I/AAAAAAAACMQ/aMVxdxxYk1k/s1600/100_0241.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-12-31-image-0005.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><b>Friday 30th December</b><br />I couldn't let my folks escape without featuring in a photo - so here they are waving us off on our way back to Edinburgh - Granny and Grandad N<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hU1iyHJvw6Q/Tv-H9DK2THI/AAAAAAAACMY/Pc0qJNoos6M/s1600/100_0250.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-12-31-image-0006.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Saturday 31st December</b><br />Happy Hogmanay chaos earlier this evening, when some lovely friends threw open their home to a horde of rampaging tots! There was laughter, there were tears, and someone took their trousers off - sounds just like student days again...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YL6CJQlEOws/Tv-IFXQut4I/AAAAAAAACMg/zMMr3aJhwVk/s1600/100_0258.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-12-31-image-0007.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br />I hope you've enjoyed my ramblings, and a little insight into my view of our world. I'm not leaving blog-land behind - I'll still be updating Makey-Cakey regularly with crafts, cakes and I daresay a fair few photos of Mini-M may sneak in there too, just with a little less structure!<br /><br />And finally of course, Happy New Year! I hope 2012 brings health and happiness to you and yours, where you are. Rx
