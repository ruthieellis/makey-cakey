Before reading any further I warn you this is a bit of a disaster post. Firstly, it is 3 minutes to 11 at night, and I have to get up in too few hours for work to really be contemplating starting blogging - but since today is the <a href="http://thedaringkitchen.com/">Daring Bakers</a> challenge posting day and I only just realised, I'm doing just that.<br />Secondly, I took awful photos of my challenge bake.<br />Thirdly, I can't find the blog that I used as my recipe inspiration, and the internet is a big place. Yes, I know it's in my history, but I can't bring myself to trawl that far back!<br /><br />So the end result is some really bad pictures of some mystery crackers.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9OKh1Pv7TtM/US6TBrca4wI/AAAAAAAAFNc/20TeUk_np3c/s1600/100_4466.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-02-27-image-0000.JPG" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Leaning tower of mystery crackers in the spotlight...</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xfMqfMyccf4/US6TD3_7Y2I/AAAAAAAAFNk/6C01ZuisXZA/s1600/100_4469.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-02-27-image-0001.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Leaning tower of mystery crackers in the gloom...</td></tr></tbody></table>But enough virtual moping. The crackers themselves were really good. Properly crunchy with a real cracker snap. Even when cold (miracle). Even after 4 days in a plastic box (even bigger miracle). So I do slightly wish I'd bookmarked the recipe - oops!<br /><br />They were made without flour, but with cooked quinoa, bulghur wheat and rice couscous that was blended along with ground flaxseed, water, soy sauce, ginger infused oil, and a Japanese sprinkle mix including seaweed and sesame seeds.<br /><br />Thanks for a really tasty challenge - and here's hoping I stumble across the recipe at some point again in the future ;o)<br /><br />Sarah from <a href="http://allourfingersinthepie.blogspot.co.uk/">All Our Fingers in the Pie</a> was our February Daring Bakers' host and she challenges us to use our creativity in making our own Crisp Flatbreads and Crackers!<br /><br />
