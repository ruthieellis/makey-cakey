Day of annual leave for Mr E and myself - day at nursery for Mini-M!

The coconut sorbet was amazing - mainly since it was heavily laced with rum :o)<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-11-12-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-11-12-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />
