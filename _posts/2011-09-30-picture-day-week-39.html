Friday again! It's been a lovely sunny and hot week - very un-autumnal, but it does feel like a small compensation for some of the disgustingness of the "summer" we had. According to the forecaster tho, there will be frost and a chance of snow by the middle of next week - yikes! Hopefully Mini-M's wellies will arrive before then...<br /><br /><b>Saturday 24th September</b><br />Story time on the balcony - taken through the living room window before Mini-M and Mr E realised I was watching. Bunny knew all along though...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DXh30UvY2uo/ToYaTQo-r2I/AAAAAAAABY0/LJjDalqVZTY/s1600/101_0166.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DXh30UvY2uo/ToYaTQo-r2I/AAAAAAAABY0/LJjDalqVZTY/s400/101_0166.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Sunday 25th September</b><br />Piglets at the East Coast Organics farm open day. Mini-M was OK with the piglets, but the pigs (and goats) provoked the sort of abject terror I would have thought should have been reserved for an approaching zombie army, rampaging hungry tigers, or a swarm of killer bees. So that's goats, pigs and cats on the epic fear list... and I suspect there may be more additions in the not too distant future!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nXsuVfuatag/ToYaV2OsTAI/AAAAAAAABY4/lzZhnQtyoj4/s1600/101_0238.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nXsuVfuatag/ToYaV2OsTAI/AAAAAAAABY4/lzZhnQtyoj4/s400/101_0238.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Monday 26th September</b><br />Working the hat, babygrow and slippers look. Quite a combination!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4YrI1WC75n4/ToYaZ2AUkjI/AAAAAAAABY8/MfsbDfMgxj0/s1600/101_0255.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4YrI1WC75n4/ToYaZ2AUkjI/AAAAAAAABY8/MfsbDfMgxj0/s400/101_0255.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Tuesday 27th September</b><br />Spot the mistake - or is it?! Maybe a burguer is something entirely different - either way at Â£3 including chips, I'm pretty sure it's not worth risking the food poisoning and artery clogging to find out.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Qnhj5QaTt1Y/ToYad1ebS5I/AAAAAAAABZA/S3ygZFqfXuk/s1600/101_0262.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Qnhj5QaTt1Y/ToYad1ebS5I/AAAAAAAABZA/S3ygZFqfXuk/s400/101_0262.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Wednesday 28th September</b><br />Jen the Giraffe wearing a hat - it's all about hats right now.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iDuT0tIIPsQ/ToYaiDihKvI/AAAAAAAABZE/gIaP5vREdco/s1600/101_0282.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iDuT0tIIPsQ/ToYaiDihKvI/AAAAAAAABZE/gIaP5vREdco/s400/101_0282.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Thursday 29th September</b><br />A dairy-free fish pie concoction portioned up ready for freezing. Since it made 10 servings, that is pretty much a guarantee that Mini-M will hate it. Had it only made 1, it would have been an instant hit... Oh well - it can join the assortment of other food failures lurking in the freezer.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q1rUSquwIQk/ToYamwzdWFI/AAAAAAAABZI/gcwlsAzkj2M/s1600/101_0300.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q1rUSquwIQk/ToYamwzdWFI/AAAAAAAABZI/gcwlsAzkj2M/s400/101_0300.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><b>Friday 30th September</b><br />Making the most of the sunshine with a lunchtime picnic in Queen Street Gardens - Mr E and Mini-M came to meet me during my lunch break and we were joined by Mrs McC who was also in need of a brief office escape.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NR48jOg2iEE/ToYap_fODxI/AAAAAAAABZM/DxvPT5muwfA/s1600/101_0331.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NR48jOg2iEE/ToYap_fODxI/AAAAAAAABZM/DxvPT5muwfA/s400/101_0331.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />And that's it for another week!<br /><br />
