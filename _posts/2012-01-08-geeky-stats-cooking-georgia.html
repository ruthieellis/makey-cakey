So, I'm onto my second country of many many still to go on my weird and wonderful culinary world tour. If you're not sure what on earth I'm talking about, then I suggest you have a quite read of this post, where I explain my madcap scheme.<br /><br />And that country is... Georgia. Purely coincidental that it's another 'G' country, after Gibraltar last time - I'm definitely not doing it alphabetically, but I did have a lot of potatoes needing used, and some walnuts lurking in the cupboard, so this seemed a good option.<br /><br />It was delicious - a very different alternative to normal potato salad, and the taste of the walnuts was fantastic - not too overpowering but nutty and creamy with just the right hint of bitterness. My recipe is based on this one, at <a href="http://georgiantaste.blogspot.com/">Georgian Taste</a> (which doesn't seem to be a current site - the last update was in 2007, but thankfully recipes are timeless), for <a href="http://georgiantaste.blogspot.com/2007/12/kartopili-nigvzit-potatoes-with-walnuts.html">Kartopili Nigvzit</a>, and made a few tweaks to make it dairy free. I &nbsp;opted to cook the garlic so it wasn't so overpowering, in the hope that Mini-M might eat it, but she was having another funny food day, so I'm not sure any of it even made it into her mouth. Oh well - one of these days we'll stumble across something she loves!<br /><br /><b>Georgian Potatoes with Walnuts</b> (Serves 6)<br /><ul><li>700g potatoes (not floury)</li><li>1 medium onion</li><li>1tbsp dairy free margarine</li><li>1 cup shelled walnuts</li><li>1 clove of garlic</li><li>Large pinch of salt</li><li>2 tsp dried dill</li><li>2 tbsp white wine vinegar</li><li>2 tbsp olive oil</li></ul>Peel and chop the potatoes into chunks and boil until tender but not too soft.<br />Whilst the potatoes are cooking, finely chop the onion and crush the garlic, then saute both in the melted margarine.<br />In a food processor, blitz the walnuts into a crumbly paste, then stir in the dill, vinegar, cooked onions and garlic. Salt and pepper to taste. Add a splash of olive oil it if is very stiff.<br />Whilst the potatoes are still warm, mix into the nuts, stirring well - they will start to break up a little.<br />Eat at room temperature<br /><br />We enjoyed it served with Polish sausage and green beans.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-18JYk2s2B14/TwoXX4Z4r4I/AAAAAAAACPU/t7DZZQOzI40/s1600/100_0357.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-18JYk2s2B14/TwoXX4Z4r4I/AAAAAAAACPU/t7DZZQOzI40/s320/100_0357.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Not an amazing photo, but almost passable...</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DAJSFZAIflw/TwoXf1lDJcI/AAAAAAAACPc/OeXlurCfEfU/s1600/100_0367.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DAJSFZAIflw/TwoXf1lDJcI/AAAAAAAACPc/OeXlurCfEfU/s320/100_0367.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">...the worst close up in the world!</td></tr></tbody></table>My photography needs some work!
