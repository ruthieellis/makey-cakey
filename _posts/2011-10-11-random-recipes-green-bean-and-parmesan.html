<br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The inspiration behind <a href="http://belleaukitchen.blogspot.com/2011/10/random-recipes-9-ill-show-you-mine-if.html">October's Random Recipe challenge</a> was "I'll show you mine if you show me yours" - not in any way as dodgy as it sounds - it was all about cookbooks, and thought up by Dom of <a href="http://belleaukitchen.blogspot.com/">Belleau Kitchen.</a></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">We were all paired off randomly with another inhabitant of blog-land, and first up we had to have a bit of a confessional on the cookbook front. After a quick count I admitted to having 68. Which I am secretly quite proud that I have managed to fit them all into two shelves of the bookcase - that's some tight packing, and lots of little books! The idea was then as follows - we each chose a random number for the other, which was the book we had to cook from, and then chose a page number which determined the recipe.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">I was paired with Karen at <a href="http://lavenderandlovage.blogspot.com/">Lavender and Lovage</a> (Hi!), who chose book no.55, page no.55. A sigh of relief when I discovered it was 'The Soup Bible' and not a cake decorating book! It's been a hectic few weeks and fitting in some extra sugar flowers would have been tricky. I have to confess my heart then sank a little when I discovered that page no.55 was in the 'Rich and Creamy Soups' section. I can only have a tiny amount of dairy at the moment - which is an improvement of none a few weeks ago, but still not easily compatible with 'rich and creamy'. So I have to confess, I missed out the cream, because it was only a small amount, and didn't put the cheese on my serving. And another confession... I didn't have Parmesan (what with not eating dairy, the cheese section of our fridge is somewhat scant, unless you count 'Cheezly', and I most definitely don't - that's reserved for Mini-M's consumption who hasn't ever eaten real cheese to know what a disappointing imitation it is!</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">So as a result 'Green Bean and Parmesan Soup' turned into 'Green Bean Soup' for me, and 'Green Bean Soup with Cheddar' for Mr E.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E13bHRronYI/TpS0ZslyytI/AAAAAAAABcI/xM082rP3aVs/s1600/101_0411.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E13bHRronYI/TpS0ZslyytI/AAAAAAAABcI/xM082rP3aVs/s400/101_0411.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Oh yeah - one more confession - as well as green beans, I had some runner beans in the fridge from our <a href="http://www.eastcoastorganics.co.uk/">East Coast Organics Veg Box</a> needing used, so I chucked them in too!</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">So here is both the original, and my massively corrupted recipe...</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><b>Green Bean Soup </b>(Serves 4)</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><ul><li>25g butter (or dairy free margarine)</li><li>225g green beans, trimmed (or 180g green beans, and 150g runner beans)</li><li>1 garlic clove crushed (I didn't mess with this bit!)</li><li>450ml vegetable stock (or chicken, since I'd run out of Marigold granules)</li><li>40g grated Parmesan cheese (or cheddar)</li><li>50ml single cream (or not!)</li><li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li><li>2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley (or not!)</li></ul><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Melt the butter in a medium saucepan.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Top and tail the green beans, (and cut the runner beans into 5cm chunks).&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Add the beans and garlic to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes over a medium heat, stirring regularly.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Stir in the stock, and season with salt and pepper.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Bring to the boil, and simmer for 10-15 minutes, uncovered, until the beans are tender.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Pour the soup into a blender and process until smooth.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Pour through a sieve back into the pan (this gets rid of the stringy bits from the runner beans).</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Stir in the Parmesan and cream, and sprinkle with the parsley, then serve.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H2ebVq-5LSw/TpS0edDHlWI/AAAAAAAABcQ/r5KjKC5F_K4/s1600/101_0414.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H2ebVq-5LSw/TpS0edDHlWI/AAAAAAAABcQ/r5KjKC5F_K4/s400/101_0414.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Given that I missed out or messed up with half of the ingredients, this was a really lovely soup. I will definitely make it again if I have green beans or runner beans to use up. Mr E said the cheese was nice, although if I was going to be having cheese in it, I'd definitely go for Parmesan rather than cheddar, because melted cheddar in soup goes a bit weird in my mouth - but that's just my personal preference.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">I imagine the cream would be a lovely addition too. One to revisit in the future.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">This was a fab challenge - it introduced me to a new blog and blogger, made me make a new recipe, which to be honest I'd never otherwise have made, being more of a hearty stewy soup girl myself.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Thanks Dom! Looking forward to next month already, and of course seeing what everyone else has made.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dL3LOe5CdGM/TpS0OBfgrhI/AAAAAAAABcA/ToA-gNSJj-0/s1600/randomrecipes2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dL3LOe5CdGM/TpS0OBfgrhI/AAAAAAAABcA/ToA-gNSJj-0/s1600/randomrecipes2.jpg" style="cursor: move;" /></a></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><br />
