I love finding unexpected supermarket bargains - particularly stuff that is marked down for quick sale with no apparent reason.<br /><br />Like this jar of wholeberry cranberry sauce that was reduced to 10p! Since it still had 6 months on its shelf life, was undamaged and the seal was still good, I snapped it up.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-09-10771d5a5f-large-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-10-image-0000.JPG" width="199" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-09-1015394917-large-image-0001.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-10-image-0001.JPG" width="199" /></a></div><br /><br />It sat in my cupboard for a while and from time to time I would look at it and feel smug. Then suddenly I decided I wanted to make a cake with it. And for some reason I decided it also needed to have cola and chocolate in it. Turns out there aren't many recipes out there for dairy free cranberry, cola and chocolate cakes - not a bit surprise - so I decided to make one up.<br /><br />I used a Nigella Lawson recipe for Chocolate and Cola cake as a starter, and in my customary way, completely messed around with all the quantities and ingredients until I ended up with something completely different.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-09-10dc98353b-large-image-0002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-10-image-0002.JPG" width="319" /></a></div><br /><br />What I actually created tasted neither of cranberry, cola or even that much of chocolate. But it was a really lovely densely crumbed, gooey, slightly fruity, slightly spiced, lightly chocolaty cake that was perfect with a cuppa, and is definitely now on my make again list. Hence it's appearance here, so that I don't lose the recipe!<br /><br /><b>Cranberry Chocolate Cola Cake with Chocolate Icing</b><br />Makes 1 large (12 inch) bundt ring<br /><br />For the Cake:<br /><ul><li>300g Plain Flour</li><li>250g Granulated Sugar</li><li>1tsp Baking Powder</li><li>1/2 tsp Bicarbonate of Soda</li><li>A Pinch of Salt</li><li>1 large egg</li><li>100ml Oatly Oat Milk (any type of milk would work)</li><li>1tsp Vanilla Extract</li><li>125g Dairy Free Sunflower Margarine</li><li>25g Cocoa Powder</li><li>175ml Cola</li><li>225g Cranberry Sauce (I used wholeberry)</li></ul><br />For the Icing:<br /><br /><ul><li>30g Dark Chocolate (I used 72% cocoa solids)</li><li>30g Dairy Free Sunflower Margarine</li><li>3tbsp Cola</li></ul><br />Preheat the oven to 180C (Fan 160C). Grease a large 12 inch bundt tin well.<br />In a large bowl sieve together the flour, sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt.<br />Measure the milk into a measuring jug, add the egg and vanilla and beat well.<br />In a saucepan, melt the margarine, cocoa powder, cranberry sauce and cola, heating gently until it has all melted and combined together.<br />Pour the melted mixture into the flour mixture, give it a quick stir, then add the egg and milk mixture and beat well until well blended and smooth.<br />Pour into the prepared tin and put the tin on a baking sheet.<br />Bake for about 40 mins, or until a skewer inserted into the deepest part comes out clean.<br />Once cooked remove from the oven and leave in the tin for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, and slide a sheet of newspaper underneath to catch the inevitable icing drips.<br />Sieve the icing sugar and leave to the side for a moment. Put the butter, cola and dark chocolate in a small saucepan, and heat over a really low heat until smooth and combined.<br />Add the icing sugar gradually until you have a thick but still runny icing (think a bit thicker than double cream).<br />Spoon the icing all over whilst the cake is still warm, and leave to set and cool before transferring it to a serving plate and enjoying!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-09-105e5fa6d3-large-image-0003.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-10-image-0003.JPG" width="319" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br />
