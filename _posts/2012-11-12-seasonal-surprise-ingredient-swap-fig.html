It's been a little quiet on the blogging front lately, as a combination of a slightly more hectic few weeks than usual plus generally feeling slightly yucky during a dairy reintroduction trial has meant that I seem to have lacked either the time of motivation most evenings. But tonight I've got a little bit of both.<br /><br />So without further ado, I should get on with the blog posting!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nibQXR83xrM/UKFrjQ2hhiI/AAAAAAAAEGg/SZJc9rIwaVw/s1600/IMGP5600.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-11-12-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Baked at the weekend so photographed in daylight - a commodity in short supply!</td></tr></tbody></table>This is my submission into the <a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/seasonal-surprise-ingredient-swap.html">Seasonal Surprise Ingredient Swap</a> which I organised. A roundup of all the delicious creations will go up here on the 1st December.<br /><br />My swap partner was <a href="http://cake-cookie-pie.blogspot.co.uk/">What's for Dessert</a> who sent me a lovely package of dried figs all the way from Croatia. Thanks to the postal service (no doubt of several countries) they arrived safely after their international assignment, and I began to think about what to make.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OAUWmFS3rDY/UKFq_7TDA0I/AAAAAAAAEF4/2Jsz3TNxG6M/s1600/IMGP5574.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-11-12-image-0001.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">A wheel of tightly packed dried figs</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eOmJNZTgJbU/UKFrG5ybTqI/AAAAAAAAEGA/gj1xU7ok6d4/s1600/IMGP5576.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-11-12-image-0002.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Chopped and ready to be caked up</td></tr></tbody></table>In the end, I made a Fig, Almond, Lemon &amp; Olive Oil cake inspired by this recipe for <a href="http://moi-natali.livejournal.com/68587.html">Lemon-Fig Pie</a> at &nbsp;<a href="http://moi-natali.livejournal.com/">Le Monde do Mademoiselle Natali</a> (scroll down the page for the English recipe). I made some substitutions to make it dairy free, and added the almonds, so here's my adapted version.<br /><br /><b>Fig, Almond, Lemon &amp; Olive Oil Cake </b>(Makes a 9" cake)<br /><br /><ul><li>1 cup plain flour</li><li>1/2 cup ground almonds</li><li>250g dried figs</li><li>1 egg</li><li>1/2 cup sugar</li><li>1/2 cup mild olive oil</li><li>1/2 cup almond milk</li><li>zest of 1 lemon</li><li>1 tsp lemon extract</li><li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li><li>pinch of salt</li></ul><br />Grease a 9 inch cake tin and preheat the oven to 180C (160C fan).<br />Chop the figs into coarse chunks.<br />Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl, then stir in the sugar, ground almonds, salt, baking powder and lemon zest.<br />Beat the eggs in a jug, then add the oil, milk, lemon extract and mix.<br />Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix gently until combined.<br />Add the chopped figs and stir them in until evenly distributed.<br />Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for around 30 mins until golden and springs back when touched in the centre.<br />Allow to cool in the tin for 5 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack until cold.<br />Dredge with icing sugar to serve.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l5Bn8POYRys/UKFrOZ_z4WI/AAAAAAAAEGI/cytlLJXxAds/s1600/IMGP5580.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-11-12-image-0003.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Just out of the oven and unadorned</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Tj6Avx32l8U/UKFrV7NvYfI/AAAAAAAAEGQ/FP01SymNR_o/s1600/IMGP5582.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-11-12-image-0004.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The bottom of the cake - despite the figgy bits it still popped out of the tin</td></tr></tbody></table>As a little aside... When I was a kid growing up, I used to love reading my Mum's cookbooks. One that sticks in my memory in particularly was called 'Home Baking' (or some similarly catch title) anyway, in it there was a picture of a chocolate cake that had been dusted with icing sugar over a doily to create a mosaic texture. I always wanted to make cake that looked like that. I'm not entirely sure why I never made this known, since I'm sure that at some point during my childhood, there would have been some doilies lurking in the kitchen drawer, and a fair likelihood that their passing presence in the kitchen may have coincided with cake baking. However, I don't ever remember making doily-pattern icing sugar, somehow saving for something I could do when I was a grown up. Well now I am, and sometimes I do!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iJgRT4adiqA/UKFrqc8R8KI/AAAAAAAAEGo/ZlHUzRp6z1M/s1600/IMGP5601.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-11-12-image-0005.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">1970s doily chic</td></tr></tbody></table>This cake is lovely - the moistness of the almonds, the crunch and sweetness of the figs and a light lemony tang. The olive oil I used, although labelled 'light and mild' does have a reasonably pronounced flavour which comes through a little and I like the way it cuts the sweetness, however if you prefer your &nbsp;cake 100% sweet, then make sure you use very mild olive oil (or even another flavourless oil).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Xl900G5-CQw/UKFr0TdvwvI/AAAAAAAAEGw/BJ0m0gqWpSQ/s1600/IMGP5606.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-11-12-image-0006.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Wouldn't win any WI prizes with all the fruit sunk to the bottom :o(</td></tr></tbody></table>Thanks <a href="http://cake-cookie-pie.blogspot.co.uk/">What's for Dessert!</a>
