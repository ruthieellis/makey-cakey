Can't believe it's almost a month since I last posted - it only seems like a few days! I really wanted to get a normal post in before the next Daring Bakers challenge - I was hoping for more than one, and indeed I've actually made stuff, and taken photographs, and uploaded them to the computer, it's just the blogging bit I've been slacking on.<br />This month has been spent getting to grips with dairy free baking, as I'm on a strict no dairy diet as the very lovely 4 month old mini M seems to be lactose intolerant - hopefully just temporarily!<br />I was excited to find some ready made puff pastry (cheating I know, but I just don't have anywhere near that much spare time) that was dairy free, and made up some lentil dhal to which I threw in some extra mango chutney, cavolo nero and grated carrot, and lo and behold, these lentil pasties were born.<br />They tasted amazing, and I wish I had remembered the quantities I used, because if I could repeat them, I'm sure they would become firm favourites. Sadly one of the pitfalls of cooking without a recipe, and not writing anything down until about 3 weeks later! I think I can just about remember what went in...and will leave it up to anyone out there that fancies it to experiment with their own quantities<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TO5wBrjUJSI/AAAAAAAAARQ/rAtWT0KoNqk/s1600/100_5208.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010-11-25-image-0000.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5543491365512684834" border="0" /></a><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lentil Pasties</span><br /><ul><li>Red Lentils</li><li>Onion</li><li>Garlic</li><li>Ginger</li><li>Chili</li><li>Cumin</li><li>Fennel seeds</li><li>Mustard seeds</li><li>Turmeric</li><li>Grated carrot</li><li>Finely chopped cavolo nero (or any other sort of greens or cabbage would also work)</li><li>Mango chutney</li><li>Puff Pastry</li><li>Beaten Egg</li><li>Salt &amp; Pepper</li></ul>And I will say proudly, that these were WAY better than any of the pasties or bakes Greggs has to offer :o)<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TO5wCC7nnUI/AAAAAAAAARY/YIjf5vQfq_U/s1600/100_5213.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010-11-25-image-0001.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5543491371788639554" border="0" /></a>
