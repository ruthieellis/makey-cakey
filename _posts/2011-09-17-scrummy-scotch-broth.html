Here's another soup recipe from the variety I made for September's Daring Cook's Challenge. The post would have been truly epic if I'd included them all, so I'm following it up with a few individual recipe posts.<br /><br />This morning I posted Cullen Skink (a Scottish creamy smoked haddock and potato soup). Now it's time for another traditional Scottish soup - Scotch Broth. Both Cullen Skink and Scotch broth are unlike many other soups in that they don't require stock to be made in advance - it is cooked integrally with the soup, so to speak, making it easy on the washing up, preparation, and of course cheap too!<br /><br />Scotch Broth is a thick hearty soup made with lamb, barley and vegetables, and is delicious when it's cold and wintry outside - perfect since last week the weather suddenly changed from slightly summery to positively baltic. Now it's back to feeling just slightly autumnal - more appropriate for mid September thank goodness.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-09-1734656c1f-large-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-17-image-0000.JPG" width="319" /></a></div><br /><br />To make a successful Scotch Broth you need to get some nice lamb on the bone that has a good amount of fat to make it flavourful too. I got what I think (pardon my poor butchery knowledge) are neck pieces. They were being sold in the supermarket 'basic' range just as 'stewing lamb' but since I got 4 bits for Â£2.90 it seemed to be the sensible option, and I didn't spend too long puzzling anatomically!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-09-171ca39d04-large-image-0001.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-17-image-0001.JPG" width="319" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Scotch Broth</b> (Serves 4 as a main meal)<br /><br /><ul><li>Approx 500g neck of lamb or mutton</li><li>2 medium onions finely chopped</li><li>2 carrots peeled and diced</li><li>1/2 a large turnip (or swede) peeled and diced</li><li>2 tbsp barely</li><li>1 tbsp yellow split peas</li><li>1 tbsp puy lentils (not traditional at all!)</li><li>2 dried bay leaves</li><li>1tsp dried thyme</li><li>Salt and pepper</li><li>Water</li></ul><br />Put the lamb in a large pan, cover with cold water, and bring to the boil, then continue to boil for about 10 mins until any scum floats to the surface.<br />Remove the lamb, and give it a rinse under the tap. Pour away the water, and give the pan a quick wash.<br />Put the lamb back into the clean pan, add the bay leaves, thyme, onion, carrot and a pinch of salt and pepper.<br />Add enough cold water again to cover the ingredients, and put back on the heat. Bring up to a gentle boil then turn the temperature down low, cover, and simmer for about an hour and a half.<br />Once the meat is tender, add the turnip, barley, split peas and lentils, a mug full of boiling water and then simmer for about another hour until the pulses are cooked.<br />Take the lamb out of the pot, allow to cook slightly so that you don't burn your fingers, then separate the meat from the bone/fat/gristle.<br />Roughly chop or shred the meat and return to the pot. Depending on how meaty your pieces were individually you may not want to add it all back in. I only added half back - there was loads of it - and used the other half to make a lamb, tomato and couscous pilaf later in the week.<br />Reheat and add more seasoning to your taste.<br />Serve with some crusty bread for dunking - making it a complete meal in a bowl.<br />Yum!<br /><br /><br />
