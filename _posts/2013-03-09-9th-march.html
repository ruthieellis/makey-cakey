<p>Today was the mummy school Christmas party - a mere three months later than originally planned. There was a secret Santa and Mini-M was given some awesome chocolate scented glittery playdough (plus the recipe to recreate it) and not only that but it came with mini cupcake cases and extra 'sprinkles'. I think her mind was well and truly blown by the wild animal sequins! Elephants mummy! And horses!<br>Thanks Santa!<br></p><div class='separator' style='clear: both; text-align: center;'> <a href='http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Hooc7cuVGB0/UTvBi0qbH0I/AAAAAAAAFVU/oRjzTxq0L-k/s1600/20130309_173649.jpg' imageanchor='1' style='margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;'> <img border='0' src='http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Hooc7cuVGB0/UTvBi0qbH0I/AAAAAAAAFVU/oRjzTxq0L-k/s640/20130309_173649.jpg' /> </a> </div>
