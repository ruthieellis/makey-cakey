I've been working full time again for almost a year - it has certainly passed at quite a pace. And sometimes I feel like I'm a bit of a part-time Mum.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>I leave the house bleary eyed at 7:15am, then rush home at the end of the day, generally managing to get there about 15 minutes before Mr E and Mini-M and just about managing to get tea on the table as they are arriving home.</div><div><br /></div><div>Mr E does nursery drop off and pick up, and Mini-M also has two Daddy days each week, when they hit playgroup, the swimming pool, the park, the home brew shop and other places of small person / Dad entertainment.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's probably not exactly how we might have imagined things working out, but it does seem to do just that - work. However that doesn't stop me feeling just a little bit guilty sometimes - I think there's always something that Mums feel guilty about: it's part of the job description.</div><div><br /></div><div>Knowing that I feel guilty about being at work, whilst he is honing his toddler negotiating skills, after a day of nap refusal and tantrums is probably little comfort for Mr E however, so I thought I'd use an afternoon off a few weeks back to put together some activity bags which might be a little bit more helpful!</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-10-14375d9c82-large-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-10-14-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>After a mammoth Google/Pinterest bashing session, I came up with a series of easy and cheap activities that mainly comprised of materials we had already kicking around the house, or were easy to get hold of, and grouped them into bags, which I labelled and sealed with tape, to prevent little fingers doing unsupervised investigating:</div><div><ul><li>Googley Eyed Ghosties</li><li>Gumdrop Construction</li><li>Butterfly Snack Bags</li><li>Neon Stained Glass</li><li>Tape Resist Painting</li><li>Masking Tape Race Track</li><li>Insect Fossil Biscuits</li><li>Paper Button Flowers</li></ul></div><div>This post is therefore as much for Mr E as a reference than anything else - since I didn't actually include any instructions.... (!) Here's the end point of each bag.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-10-14219c7fa6-large-image-0001.aspx?page=5&amp;MsdVisit=1"><img border="0" height="247" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-10-14-image-0001.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>&nbsp;<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-10-14219c7fa6-large-image-0001.aspx?page=5&amp;MsdVisit=1">Butterfly Treats from Toddler Craft Ideas (That Won't Stress You Out) at the Bump</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/345396/fossil-cookies"><img border="0" height="320" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-10-14-image-0002.jpg" width="256" /></a></div>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/345396/fossil-cookies">Fossil Cookies from Martha Stewart</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://tinkerlab.com/halloween-tradition-little-fabric-ghosts/"><img border="0" height="212" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-10-14-image-0003.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><a href="http://tinkerlab.com/halloween-tradition-little-fabric-ghosts/">&nbsp;Halloween Tradition: Little Fabric Ghosts at Tinkerlab</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://tinkerlab.com/gumdrop-sculptures/"><img border="0" height="212" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-10-14-image-0004.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>&nbsp;<a href="http://tinkerlab.com/gumdrop-sculptures/">Gumdrop Sculptures at Tinkerlab</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.multiplesandmore.com/crafting-with-kids/crafting-with-kids-mother%E2%80%99s-day-art/"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-10-14-image-0005.jpg" /></a><span id="goog_665628271"></span><span id="goog_665628272"></span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/"></a></div><a href="http://www.multiplesandmore.com/crafting-with-kids/crafting-with-kids-mother%E2%80%99s-day-art/">&nbsp;Crafting with Kids: Mother's Day Art at Multiples and More</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://tinkerlab.com/diy-paper-tape-roads/"><img border="0" height="212" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-10-14-image-0006.jpg" width="320" /></a><span id="goog_665628279"></span><span id="goog_665628280"></span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/"></a></div><a href="http://tinkerlab.com/diy-paper-tape-roads/">&nbsp;DIY Paper Tape Roads at Tinkerlab</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lilsugar.com/Spray-Paint-Craft-Kids-24173250/"><img border="0" height="320" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-10-14-image-0007.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div><a href="http://www.lilsugar.com/Spray-Paint-Craft-Kids-24173250/">Spray Paint My Name!
