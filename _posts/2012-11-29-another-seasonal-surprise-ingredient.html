Only two more days to go before I post the&nbsp;<a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/seasonal-surprise-ingredient-swap.html">Surprise Ingredient Swap</a>&nbsp;roundup - it's sure to be mouthwatering.<br /><br />But before that, another guest post - well, not quite so much a guest post this time, as a post-on-behalf-of!<br /><br />Not to be outdone on the swapping and baking front, my Dad wanted to get in on the action as well as my Mum!<br /><br />In actual fact, he probably bakes more frequently that my Mum, as he's a regular bread maker, so I have to confess I fully expected his seasonal surprise ingredient swap creation to be bread. However he pushed the boat out and went for cake! A slightly adventurous one at that - a Lemon, Creme Fraiche and Chestnut Cake which you can find the recipe of on the <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/5059/lemon-crme-frache-and-chestnut-cake">BBC Goodfood website here</a>.<br /><br />And his surprise ingredient? Well, he was sent some very exciting chestnut flour from <a href="http://cookingmanu.blogspot.co.uk/">Cooking Manu</a>.<br /><br />Here's the finished cake<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mVkCzFy467U/ULfYrz1hoTI/AAAAAAAAEbM/zbvAbTbUku8/s1600/P1030794.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-11-29-image-0000.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />And a few words from the baker...<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">"Here is my creation at last. Trying something new is always interesting and the chestnut flour gives the overall cake a lovely nutty taste. I also learned the hard way that whisking up egg whites until stiff is a waste of time if there is even a trace of yolk........and I had exactly that. The overall texture is very moist so the cake might do better as a sweet, with sticky sauce poured over it. Finally a very big thanks to <a href="http://cookingmanu.blogspot.co.uk/">Manu</a> for the challenging ingredient."</span>
