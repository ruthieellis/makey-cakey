The theme for <a href="http://www.belleaukitchen.com/2013/05/random-recipes-28-bread.html">May's Random Recipes challenge</a>, hosted as every at <a href="http://www.belleaukitchen.com/">Belleau Kitchen</a> is bread.<br /><br />My Dad makes awesome bread. (In fact Mini-M regularly requests "Grandad's Bread")<br /><br />I don't. Most of my bread making attempts have been distinctly doughy in the middle, and somewhat stunted in stature.<br /><br />I did consider getting him to make some, then passing it off as my own but I'm a terrible fibber! Plus I've posted plenty of other culinary failures here over the past few years, so why not add bread to the list.<br /><br />Since this is the 28th Random Recipes challenge, I decided to take the 28th recipe book from my shelf and hope that it had some bread recipe in it, so I ended up with "Ottolenghi The Cookbook". And indeed, there on page 166 was a recipe for Sour Cherry and Walnut Stick. It didn't make a huge quantity, which sounded ideal - small scale disasters are always preferable!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yxrmBHJlH1U/UYq-yNoA7jI/AAAAAAAAFzc/Re1jZvthZ2g/s1600/2013-05-07+20.30.56.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yxrmBHJlH1U/UYq-yNoA7jI/AAAAAAAAFzc/Re1jZvthZ2g/s400/2013-05-07+20.30.56.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Not so 'stick' like...</td></tr></tbody></table>Did I follow the recipe properly... of course not. I think I should have called my blog "I-Can't-Follow-A-Recipe" rather than "Makey-Cakey".<br /><br />My substitutions were more minor than on some occasions - raisins for sour cherries (a change to flavour rather than texture) and millet flour instead of buckwheat flour. (Only a small amount - the primary flour is seeded wholemeal wheat flour) - again probably not critical.<br /><br />I attempted to follow the method to the letter - but it is written for using and electric stand mixer, which I don't have. My food processor does have a 'dough' blade, which I decided to give a go. Now, as you'll have gathered I'm no bread expert, however I'm pretty sure that being battered against the sides of the food mixer in a high speed ball isn't the right sort of kneading to stretch the gluten and whatever else you need to do to make bread light and bready. And I think this is borne out in the finished product - a tasty but rather dense loaf! If I was being a harsh self critic, I might liken it to dwarf bread... but much tastier!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IBP5X5J25UI/UYq-nWg8otI/AAAAAAAAFzU/jNVbPLCDqrE/s1600/2013-05-07+21.57.56.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IBP5X5J25UI/UYq-nWg8otI/AAAAAAAAFzU/jNVbPLCDqrE/s320/2013-05-07+21.57.56.jpg" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">A little dense - just like me!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I will definitely give this recipe another go - although still not following the actual recipe! Next time I'll ditch the mixer and knead by hand.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZE4H7uB8NkI/UYq-lY3xVII/AAAAAAAAFzM/IoNUd-IlYeM/s1600/2013-05-08+06.54.21.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZE4H7uB8NkI/UYq-lY3xVII/AAAAAAAAFzM/IoNUd-IlYeM/s400/2013-05-08+06.54.21.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">But... all is not lost - it is cooked in the middle!
