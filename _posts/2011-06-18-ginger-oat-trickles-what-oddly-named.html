<div style="text-align: left;">It is a fact of life that I have too many cookbooks. 2 shelves-worth to be precise, which to be honest is a lot more than I need! But for some reason recently, every time I've been needing a recipe for something, I've searched the BBCGoodFood archive, or browsed Foodgawker, and shunned the books on my shelf. So I figured they were feeling a bit left out, and made my Mid-June resolution: Cook stuff from books, not just the interweb!</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-06-18-image-0000.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5619669499196216018" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><br /></span></div><div>So my first application of the new rule was some biscuits I made last week to take along to a meeting. I used a recipe from my newest cookbook acquisition - the Mornflake Oats Biscuit Book. Who knew there were enough oat biscuits out there to dedicate a whole recipe book to them! When I saw it languishing in the remainder bin of the bargain book shop for 99p, I knew I had to rescue it (that's another bad habit of mine - rescuing 'nice' books that I find in pound shops and the like, that I feel are too good to be destined to that fate!).</div><div><br /></div><div>And flicking through, there was a recipe for the weirdly named 'Orange Oat Trickles' just that I can't leave a recipe alone, so I had to tinker with it, and made them ginger instead. Here's my modified recipe :o)</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-06-18-image-0001.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5619669485448284370" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#0000EE;"><br /></span></div><div><b>Ginger Oat Trickles (makes about 15)</b></div><div><ul><li>100g margarine (plus extra for greasing if you're not using parchment or silicone sheets)</li><li>75g caster sugar</li><li>2 tbsp golden syrup</li><li>1/2tsp ground ginger</li><li>100g rolled oats</li><li>100g self raising flour</li><li>1/2tsp bicarbonate of soda</li><li>100g icing sugar</li><li>2 scant tbsp fiery ginger beer</li></ul></div><div>Preheat the oven to 180C and line 2 baking trays with parchment. </div><div>Combine margarine, sugar &amp; syrup in a bowl and beat until fluffy. </div><div>Add the oats, flour, ginger and bicarbonate of soda, and mix until well combined (it will be a very stiff mixture).</div><div>Take generous tsp of the mixture, shape into small balls and place well-spaced on the baking sheets, then flatten slightly.</div><div>Bake for about 15 mins (swapping shelves over half way through if it's not a fan oven) until golden brown.
