A quick post, since this isn't the one I was planning to write and it sneaking in there - jumping the queue because I made these this evening for after tea, they were delicious, I didn't write the recipe down, so I'd better get on to it quick before I forget...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LGFNsqqv008/UOyDr3zZ0kI/AAAAAAAAE0k/EZ_6DD7PgPY/s1600/2013-01-08+19.02.32.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-01-08-image-0000.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Coconut and Honey Pancakes</b> (makes 6 small pancakes)<br /><br /><ul><li>1 small sachet creamed coconut</li><li>50ml boiling water</li><li>1 egg</li><li>4 tbsp self raising flour</li><li>Tiny pinch ground cloves</li><li>2 tbsp honey</li><li>1 tsp sunflower oil for frying</li></ul><br />Put the creamed coconut in your mixing bowl and immediately add the boiling water. Break the coconut up with a fork and keep working until you have a smooth, thick liquid. Add the honey, then the egg and beat well. Mix in your flour - if you're lazy like me and couldn't be bothered to sieve it, then beat it hard!!!! Stir in the ground cloves (or another spice of your choosing).<br />Heat 1 tsp of oil in a small non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Drop spoonfuls of the batter into the pan and allow to cook for a few minutes, until bubbles start to rise to the surface, then flip over and cook for another minute or two. Cool inside a folded over teatowel on a wire rack.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>These were really lovely, hence the blog post. They don't look any different to regular pancakes, but they taste a bit more special. The honey is a great natural sweetener, so they're sweet but not cloying, and they got the toddler seal of approval - Mini-M polished off two after tea. They're dairy free, refined sugar free and there's no soya milk in sight - woop!<br /><br />
