We've been on holiday - to France and back - so I'm playing catch up!<br />9th June - left home at 3am and hightailed it down the M6 (within legal speed limits of course) meaning we were ready for some fountain splashing in Bristol by 10:30am. Well Mini-M was - Mr E and I were up for sitting looking sleepy on a nearby bench.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-06-09-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-06-09-image-0000.jpg" width="265" /></a></div><br />
