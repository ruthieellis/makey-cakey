We were the lucky recipients of a big bunch of chard and another of kale when my folks visited a couple of weekends ago.<br /><br />Since we've not had our veg box, we've eaten a lot less kale! And whilst trying to think of something new and interesting do with each week's kale ration was always a bit of a challenge, I have to confess that it suddenly seemed much more exciting after a notable absence.<br /><br />I used the kale to make quick kale kimchi which may well make an appearance here in the not too distant future, however this post is all about the chard.<br /><br />It made a fantastic dairy free pesto - using pecan nuts added extra creaminess - and weirdly, Mr E and I both agreed that it did actually taste like it had cheese in it.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DE7BmVuBl5E/UkC0s3oWCoI/AAAAAAAAGvc/VYoq0WZBqiI/s1600/2013-09-16+17.44.09.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DE7BmVuBl5E/UkC0s3oWCoI/AAAAAAAAGvc/VYoq0WZBqiI/s400/2013-09-16+17.44.09.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>Chard, Pecan &amp; Lime Pesto</b> (Serves 4)<br /><br /><ul><li>A big bunch of chard - washed, caterpillars removed and stalks trimmed off</li><li>1/4 cup olive oil</li><li>2 cloves of garlic</li><li>60g pecans</li><li>pinch of salt and pepper</li><li>juice of 1/2 a lime</li></ul><br />Heat a splash of the oil in a large frying pan, and finely chop the garlic, and roughly chop the chard.<br />Sautee the garlic and chard for about 5 mins until the chard has softened.<br />Chuck everything into a food processor and blend until fairly smooth.<br />Done!<br /><br />We had this mixed through dried pasta that was infused with red chili, with some baked cherry tomatoes on the side. It was really, really tasty. Mini-M remains unconvinced - however I'm planning on making it again to try to convince her - I can't let a possible vessel to convey all the goodness of greens, via a convenient pasta sauce pass us by without another shot.<br /><br />So I'm submitting this to the <a href="http://www.tinnedtomatoes.com/p/pasta-please.html#.UkCqvxYgG5c">Pasta Please challenge</a>, masterminded by <a href="http://www.tinnedtomatoes.com/">Tinned Tomatoes</a>, and hosted this month by <a href="http://gggiraffe.blogspot.com.au/">Green Groumet Giraffe</a> who has chosen <a href="http://gggiraffe.blogspot.com.au/2013/08/im-hosting-long-pasta-please-in.html">Long Pasta </a>as the theme.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SAOFCW3Vp9A/UkC0UDtRITI/AAAAAAAAGvQ/QGnt2EFXf1Y/s1600/pasta+please.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="228" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SAOFCW3Vp9A/UkC0UDtRITI/AAAAAAAAGvQ/QGnt2EFXf1Y/s320/pasta+please.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />It also made a fantastic sandwich filling. I had mine combined with some chicken pieces, and Mr E had his with cheese.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SrcV2lVcBak/UkC0souFf9I/AAAAAAAAGvY/4Z6wkQFYjp8/s1600/2013-09-17+11.53.11.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SrcV2lVcBak/UkC0souFf9I/AAAAAAAAGvY/4Z6wkQFYjp8/s400/2013-09-17+11.53.11.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />
