<div style="text-align: left;">I think that these are my current favourite culinary discovery. Which is a bit weird, since normally I don't even like marzipan! But in these, I very much do :o)</div><div>The recipe came from the <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/10787/individual-strawberry-and-almond-tarts">BBC Good Food Magazine</a> and for once I followed it fairly closely, with only a few tweaks. I'm sure there will be many future incarnations of this recipe, as it is so easy and so good - and potentially very versatile, depending on what fruit you have to hand.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dqEhT-Xf_Lg/TaxY8ndyqjI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/ZuJ-Mbem6Pw/s400/100_6922.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5596946235324017202" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><br /></span></div><div><b>Strawberry Marzipan </b><b>Galettes</b> (makes 6)</div><div><ul><li>1 pack of ready made puff pastry, thawed if frozen (250g)</li><li>approx 250g strawberries, washed, hulled, &amp; dried</li><li>approx 200g marzipan (a bit less than half a packet)</li><li>1tbsp mild olive oil</li><li>25g sugar</li></ul></div><div>Preheat oven to 200C, and get out one large or 2 small baking trays. You don't need to grease them as you're putting puff pastry on them, which generally doesn't stick.</div><div>Slice the strawberries lengthwise into fairly thin slices (a couple of mm is good).</div><div>Roll out the pastry on a floured worksurface until about 2mm thick. Try to keep it roughly rectangular in shape as you do so.</div><div>Cut the pastry into 6, and carefully transfer each piece to the waiting baking tray. With a sharp knife, run around each piece, about half a cm in from the edge, taking care not to cut all the way through. This will help the pastry puff up around the edges.</div><div>Brush the pastry lightly with the oil.</div><div>Cut the marzipan into slices not more than half a cm thick, and place a couple in the middle of each piece of pastry.</div><div>Next layer the strawberries over the pastry so that the marzipan is covered up. You can be as artistic or haphazard as you like here, it won't affect the flavour!</div><div>Finally, sprinkle over the sugar and pop into the preheated oven for about 15mins until the pastry is risen and golden. </div><div>Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly on the tray before serving. Apparently a dollop of nice thick double cream finished it off nicely, but they also taste lovely 'neat'!</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-un43bG_F3PA/TaxY9G7uPAI/AAAAAAAAAqY/tNPq4Hz9wig/s400/100_6925.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5596946243771055106" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><br /></span></div>
