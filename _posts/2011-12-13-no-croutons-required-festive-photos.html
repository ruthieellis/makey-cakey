<a href="http://foodandspice.blogspot.com/2008/02/no-croutons-required.html">No Croutons Required</a> is usually a monthly vegetarian soup or salad challenge, but for <a href="http://www.tinnedtomatoes.com/2011/12/no-croutons-required-december.html">December</a>&nbsp;hosted by Jacqueline at <a href="http://www.tinnedtomatoes.com/">Tinned Tomatoes</a> we've been asked to share a festive photo instead in a No Croutons Christmas tradition.<br /><br />Here's mine<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B5nckz7d0dg/Tue4zA4y6xI/AAAAAAAACEw/gDfFVQoDmQw/s1600/100_4566.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B5nckz7d0dg/Tue4zA4y6xI/AAAAAAAACEw/gDfFVQoDmQw/s400/100_4566.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />It was taken on Hogmanay 2009, about a mile or so behind my parents house in Hawick.<br />I was about 10 weeks pregnant and had awful morning sickness. I'd spend virtually all of the Christmas holiday curled up in a chair feeling miserable, trying and failing to keep down dry toast and generally being a scrooge.<br />On the 31st December Mr E eventually cajoled me into going for a walk, and we made it about a mile to where this picture was taken. I'm pretty sure he also cajoled me into taking it - I think I was participating in the walk in body only, and moaning about it all the way, but looking at the photos I took afterwards, I'm glad I went - it was a stunning day!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CcyrwfuQyv4/TteccRq1uwI/AAAAAAAAIHc/Uhq6wSYyxTM/s1600/oc.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CcyrwfuQyv4/TteccRq1uwI/AAAAAAAAIHc/Uhq6wSYyxTM/s200/oc.jpg" width="133" /></a></div>
