Mini-M's first Sparkler. The firework safety chat at nursery must have been effective. She very quick to lecture us on the need to wear gloves. Indeed you'd think that we'd have been completely unaware of bonfire night had Martha not enlightened us - she spent the whole evening saying "I told you there would be fireworks! I told you there would be bonfires!"<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-11-05-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-11-05-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />
