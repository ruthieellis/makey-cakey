Oh goodness. Somehow it seems I've not written a blog post since October. And Christmas has somehow come and gone too! 2014 has hurtled past at an alarming rate.<br /><br />And it is indeed <a href="http://www.thedaringkitchen.com/">Daring Bakers</a>' posting time again.<br /><br />This is possibly the most pathetic DB post I've done in a long time. In an attempt to be lenient on myself, I'm giving myself quite a few points for effort. I baked my challenge recipe almost as soon as it was released way back at the start of December. I took a photo of it too… and then it went downhill.<br /><br />Can I find the photo - nope! Can I find the scrap of paper that I jotted down my modifications on - nope!<br /><br />So we have a challenge post with neither a photo or a recipe - and for that I apologise profusely!<br /><br />"For the month of December, Andrea from <a href="http://www.4pure.nl/en/about-2/">4pure</a> took us on a trip to the Netherlands. She challenged us to take our tastebuds on a joyride through the land of sugar and spice by baking three different types of Dutch sweet bread."<br /><br />Of the three recipes given in the challenge, I chose to make the first recipe: 'Peperkoek' cake, as it didn't need any modification to make it dairy-free.<br /><br />It called for 1 tbps cane sugar syrup, and I wasn't sure what that was, so I used treacle - given the spices involved and the dark colour of the cake, it seemed the right sort of thing - admittedly unlikely to be 100% authentic. I was also a bit scant in my spice mix, and went without cardamom, coriander and anise as I didn't have them in the spice rack. I did have cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, white pepper, mace and ginger and I chucked in a pinch of allspice too.<br /><br />I also had no whole-wheat flour - so I used 200g plain white and 50g rye.<br /><br />The cake smelled fantastic whilst cooking and infused the house with the scent of Christmas which was a lovely way to start off December.<br />It tasted pretty good too, and was very easy - yum - I'm glad to be able to add this one to my baking repertoire :-)<br /><br />So my personal challenge for January is to go for the triple - bake, photograph and blog… wish me luck!<br /><br />And so - to finish off, I shall leave you with a picture of my sous-chef Mini-M preparing another festive treat… magic reindeer food on Christmas Eve (aka carrots, glitter and crushed cereal!).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-12-27-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-12-27-image-0000.JPG" height="400" width="265" /></a></div><br />
