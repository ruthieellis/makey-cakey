Here's another creation that is normally fairly dairy intense, which I've de-dairied. I was going to type 'so that we could enjoy it' but that's not strictly true... so that I could enjoy it! I'm sure Mr E would have enjoyed the regular version more, and even the lure of blueberries couldn't encourage Mini-M to try some.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xlNlGsCXxks/T18X9XojQoI/AAAAAAAAClA/iSJ_YNAYEco/s1600/100_1155.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xlNlGsCXxks/T18X9XojQoI/AAAAAAAAClA/iSJ_YNAYEco/s400/100_1155.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />It was lovely though - and a very good way to use up some fruit that was looking slightly worse for the wear after spending the day travelling around in a Tupperware box in the car for Mini-M's snacks!<br /><br /><b>Fruity Clafoutis</b> (Serves 4-6)<br /><br /><ul><li>Fruit of your choosing - I used about 100g blueberries, 6 strawberries and half a tin of crushed pineapple, minus the juice</li><li>1tbsp dairy free margarine</li><li>25g sugar</li></ul><br />For the batter<br /><br /><ul><li>30g plain flour</li><li>10g coconut flour</li><li>(Or 65g plain flour and no coconut flour)</li><li>2 eggs</li><li>25g sugar</li><li>180ml Oatly Chocolate oat milk</li><li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li></ul><br />Melt the tbsp margarine in a small frying pan, then add the sugar an allow to melt. Chop the strawberries into chunks, and stir them and the blueberries into the melted butter an sugar. Allow to gently saut√© for a few minutes, on a low heat, but don't stir too much otherwise the blueberries will break up. Take off the heat and stir in the pineapple.<br />Preheat the oven to 200C and lightly grease a flan dish.<br />Put the fruit in the bottom of the dish<br />Beat together the batter ingredients until smooth and pour over the fruit.<br />Bake for 20 minutes until it is lightly puffed up, set to the touch and golden.<br />Allow to cool slightly before serving otherwise you'll burn your mouth with boiling blueberries!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KuxHbL2oNLg/T18YFcVyoyI/AAAAAAAAClI/ljr_DQxL5sk/s1600/100_1156.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KuxHbL2oNLg/T18YFcVyoyI/AAAAAAAAClI/ljr_DQxL5sk/s400/100_1156.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br />We also ate this cold the next day - and although that's not a conventional way to eat clafoutis, it was still delicious.
