<div style="text-align: left;">Life has been hectic and the last time I blogged was the end of June - can't believe it's now a full week through July too. Thought it was time for a crafty post, rather than a culinary one...</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WbUrw9UgX1o/ThYatoVRUPI/AAAAAAAAA9k/S9gNdDTAtVA/s320/100_7989.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5626714155669082354" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><br /></span></div><div>I made these monogrammed muslins for Mini-M not long after she started nursery to make her cloths stand out. Turns out that she's suck a mucky pup that she often comes home with her own muslin, AND one of the other children's and both are usually well drooled and snotted on. (Too much information - sorry!) </div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-69KUIA4AtPM/ThYalxryQ6I/AAAAAAAAA9U/MLQjA_580TY/s320/100_7984.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5626714020740481954" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><br /></span></div><div>Anyhow, they are quick and easy to do, and cute to boot. </div><div><br /></div><div>I took a 6 pack of plain white muslin squares, some iron on interfacing, and some material scraps and did all 6 of them in not much over an hour.</div><div><br /></div><div>First I traced my 'M' template. I then drew it onto the wrong side of the material. I followed the instructions on the iron on interfacing, and ironed one side also onto the wrong side of the material. I then cut around the 'M' outlines which I could just see through the paper. I peeled off the backing, and ironed again to attach them to the muslins. For extra security I top-stitched in white thread around each monogram, after I took these pictures.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eKOwJaHir1U/ThYauNwSdcI/AAAAAAAAA9s/Cdyjlv9lXJo/s320/100_7994.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5626714165714515394" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><br /></span></div><div>I had plans for a lovely artistic photo of all 6 muslins hanging on the washing line with the monograms flapping in the breeze. Which didn't happen because it kept raining (I made these during the wet spell we had about a month ago) and they were then pressed into service. They do now flap on the washing line, but in a kind of crumpled up just-out-of-the-washing-machine way, and have added bolognese stains - not so photogenic!</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ytj3zl4FZgA/ThYatDWE84I/AAAAAAAAA9c/EjnvcvuxBxQ/s320/100_7986.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5626714145740354434" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><br /></span></div><div>These would make a lovely new baby present for someone - I'll have to try to remember that for the next baby to be born to any of our friends and family :o)</div><div><br /></div><div>As I logged in to write this post, Blogger informed me that this is my 100th post! Woop! I feel it should perhaps be of a celebratory cake - but it isn't. You never know - maybe I will make some blog posting centenary cake this weekend...</div>
