<div style="text-align: left;">Tonight is an evening of furious blogging. Mr E is out, Mini-M is asleep, and I have a ridiculous number of recipes and projects waiting to be posted. If I don't do them soon, I will have completely forgotten the recipes and variations I used, so I'm powering through as many as I can while I have the chance...</div><div><br /></div><div>We opened a bottle of red wine a while back that had been lurking at the back of the wine cupboard for some time, shall we say! As soon as I took a sip, I knew it wasn't going to be any good for drinking - definitely on its way to being vinegar. Not too far along the way, but further than makes sipping pleasurable.</div><div><br /></div><div>Cue some furious googling to find out things to do with off red wine. I didn't really want to make that much salad dressing, or shell out for beef to casserole. And eventually I stumbled on this recipe for <a href="http://www.bigworldsmallkitchen.com/zinfandel-pasta">Zinfandel Pasta</a> at <a href="http://www.bigworldsmallkitchen.com/">big world small kitche</a>n. </div><div><br /></div><div>As usual, I didn't quite have the ingredients to hand, or the patience to follow the recipe exactly. I used some broccoli (like the recipe requires) from that week's <a href="http://www.eastcoastorganics.co.uk/">East Coast veg box</a>, and some shelled peas from the in-laws garden, which I think were an excellent addition. It also recommends using wine that isn't off - but that seems like a waste of a good drinkable bottle to me, and I can report it works perfectly well with some dodgy stuff!</div><div><br /></div><div>So here's my variation...</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; color: #0000ee;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5639705498535706770" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S7Qo-E0fTm8/TkRCRT4JwJI/AAAAAAAABKg/3RPhesD52rU/s320/IMGP4535.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 320px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; color: #0000ee;"></span></div><div><b>Red Wine Pasta</b> (Serves 4-6)</div><div><ul><li>400g-ish broccoli chopped into small pieces (if the stalk is quite tender don't be scared to use it too. If it looks a bit tough, save it to chuck into some soup)</li><li>200g-ish shelled peas</li><li>400g sugar - conchiglie in this case</li><li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li><li>1 750ml bottle of slightly vinegary red wine</li><li>50g-ish of strong goats cheese, grated</li><li>1tbsp sugar</li><li>2 tbsp olive oil</li><li>salt &amp; pepper</li></ul></div><div>Pre-cook the broccoli for a few minutes - I microwaved for a minute.</div><div>Bring a medium pan of salted water to the boil and cook the pasta for about 4 or 5 minutes, until it is starting to soften, but still a bit crunchy.</div><div>Drain the pasta, keeping back 1 cup of the cooking water.</div><div>Put the red wine into the pan you have just been using, and add the sugar.</div><div>Bring to the boil and cook until it has reduced by about a third.</div><div>Add the pasta, stirring so that i breaks up any clumps after draining, and cook for another 5-10 minutes until the pasta is al dente, rather than crunchy!</div><div>Whilst the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a small frying pan, add the garlic and soften for a few minutes. Then add the broccoli and peas, and heat until they are warmed through. The peas will take virtually no time to cook if they are fresh and small. </div><div>Once the pasta is cooked, use your culinary judgement - drain off some of the red wine liquid if required, or add some of the reserved pasta water.</div><div>Stir through the sauteed garlic, broccoli and peas, and season to your taste.</div><div>Serve sprinkled with the goats cheese.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; color: #0000ee;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5639705495882238674" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ezD7JYhCn90/TkRCRJ_hCtI/AAAAAAAABKY/k8EleseUWjo/s320/IMGP4533.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 320px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; color: #0000ee;"></span></div><div>I had no idea how this would taste - it's such an unknown concept. But it is actually really delicious - the pasta tastes wine-y but not vinegary (woop!) or too alcoholic, and the garlic, tangy cheese and sweet peas and broccoli complement each other perfectly. The colour is fantastic too - a very eye catching dish! To be honest, I'd probably not sacrifice a bottle of good wine for this, but I'll definitely be making it again with the next dodgy bottle I find. What an odd thing to be hoping for!</div>
