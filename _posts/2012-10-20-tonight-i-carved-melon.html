A rock and roll Saturday evening chez Makey-Cakey tonight...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lxnRN0eZOHQ/UIMaYFIiaVI/AAAAAAAAD68/Jr7PRSc-qcU/s1600/2012-10-20+20.39.53.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lxnRN0eZOHQ/UIMaYFIiaVI/AAAAAAAAD68/Jr7PRSc-qcU/s400/2012-10-20+20.39.53.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />I carved a watermelon, as an alternative to a 2-day-late wedding anniversary card for Mr E. (Note - I did NOT forget it was our wedding anniversary, just that I had been lacking the time/inspiration to come up with something appropriate). Apparently in the UK, your 4th year wedding anniversary is traditionally celebrated with fruit. Or so Mr E said - if I find out that is total nonsense and he was playing to my very gullible side, then I shall have to revoke the watermelon. Anyway, I did think about grafitti-ing a banana to pass time on my train journey back from Birmingham earlier in the week but thought that would probably just make me look like a crazy to the person sitting next to me on the train.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IORU-RnhRAU/UIMaTDPzSGI/AAAAAAAAD60/5os_o6vAf6U/s1600/2012-10-20+20.39.38.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IORU-RnhRAU/UIMaTDPzSGI/AAAAAAAAD60/5os_o6vAf6U/s400/2012-10-20+20.39.38.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />So instead I carved a watermelon tonight and shared the tale here, making me seem like a crazy in blog-land instead. Clearly a better plan...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l8s6oDGJY-E/UIMadYowRnI/AAAAAAAAD7E/oBMIm6QKlno/s1600/2012-10-20+20.40.29.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l8s6oDGJY-E/UIMadYowRnI/AAAAAAAAD7E/oBMIm6QKlno/s400/2012-10-20+20.40.29.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br />From time to time I also indulge my geeky side by checking my Google Analytics keywords, which lists what search terms people have used and ended up on Makey-Cakey. I also quite like the thought that by writing about some of the weirder ones here, it's a self fulfilling prophecy, because if anyone searches for the same weird combo again, this post will increase the chances of them ending up here! Hello confused internet users :o)<br /><br />Onto the search terms:<br /><br /><ul><li>"<b>can I get dairy free donuts in Glasgow</b>" - I have no idea! But I hope for the sake of the searcher than answer is yes. They like frying things in Glasgow. There's a good chance!</li><li>"<b>Cheezly muffins</b>" Don't do it!!! They are horrid. I have done it, take my word for it.</li><li>"<b>fondant rowan berries tutorial</b>" Surely you just roll up little balls of red fondant. There you go - tutorial done!</li><li>"<b>fondant squirrel</b>" Beyond my fondant modelling skills. Although fondant and squirrel as separate words probably do feature relatively often on this blog, never in the same sentence!</li><li>"<b>fudge porridge</b>" I've never made it, but it strikes me as something that would appeal to Mr E...</li><li>"<b>how to make naked wedding cake</b>" The mind boggles. How to make wedding cake whilst naked? Carefully. I am assuming the person actually meant un-iced, which is easy. Make a wedding cake. Don't ice it.</li><li>"<b>I'm making a wedding cake in advance</b>" That's nice, but you're not special - most people do! Perhaps whoever searched for this got Google confused with their diary?</li><li>"<b>ideas to fill dead space in kitchen</b>" Clearly asked by someone who doesn't cook very much, because everyone I know who does has absolutely zero dead space - it's all packed full of books, spices, pans, tins, etc etc</li><li>"<b>imperfect wedding cakes</b>" I'm slightly insulted by this - I think Google is poking fun at my cake decorating skills!</li><li>"<b>marzipan before or after royal icing</b>" BEFORE! ALWAYS! Although I would love to see the end result of someone attempting to put marzipan on after covering cake with jaggy hard set royal icing</li><li>"<b>paving over front gardens</b>" Nooooooooooo save the flowers and grass.</li><li>"<b>romanian flag love heart</b>" Honestly, I have no idea</li><li>"<b>vanilla fudge pyjamas</b>" another ?!?!!?!</li><li>"<b>vegetable = pi</b>" Mathematically untrue</li><li>"<b>what quantity</b>" that's a rather esoteric question to ask Google I can't help thinking. I'm going to go with 150g. A fairly useful quantity - not too much or too little</li></ul><div>And with that, it's time for bed. (And to my Mum who will read this and wonder... no I've not been drinking!)</div>
