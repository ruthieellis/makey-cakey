Well life has been getting in the way of updating again - it's been a hectic spell of <a href="http://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/">Borders Exploration Group</a> meetings, training and Duke of Edinburgh's Award expeditions. But I thought I had time tonight to squeeze in a <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">superfast</span> post of some sugary goodness. So sticky <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">crispie</span> was not something I had come across until I met <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Jono</span>, and since then it has become a bit legendary amongst my friends. It is probably about the most <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">unhealthy</span> piece of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">homebaking</span> that exists, but also one of the easiest and most delicious. Our Year in Industry student left work recently after spending a year with the team, keeping us on our toes, always smiling and trying to prevent us all from becoming old and boring prematurely middle-aged peeps! I decided to use the sticky <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">crispie</span> as a base to convey our good-bye message which I cut out in fondant icing and decorated with food colouring pens.<div>Here's the recipe for the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">crispie</span> - this makes 1 rectangular baking tin (<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">swiss</span> roll) full, and cuts into about 30 pieces.</div><div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/Sp7T4Ry3q9I/AAAAAAAAAMk/81Mbs715JXA/s1600-h/100_3008.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/Sp7T4Ry3q9I/AAAAAAAAAMk/81Mbs715JXA/s320/100_3008.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5376967968929852370" border="0" /></a></div><div>1x250g block of butter (I prefer slightly salted)</div><div>1x200g bag of marshmallows (mini or regular, pink or white!)</div><div>1x150g toffees (e.g. <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">McCowans</span> or <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">Werthers</span>)</div><div>Rice <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">Crispies</span> - quite a lot - a good 200g, but it depends on how sticky you want your <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">crispie</span>.</div><div><br /></div><div>Put the butter and toffee in a pan over very low heat and leave to melt, stirring occasionally. At the same time, line your tin with grease proof paper - it will make cutting and removing from the tin a LOT easier!</div><div>Once the toffee and butter have melted, tip in the marshmallows and stir continuously until melted and smooth. It will go separated for a while and then suddenly all comes together.</div><div>Add the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">crispies</span> and stir in quickly until well coated - add more or less depending on the required consistency.</div><div>Tip into the tin and flatten into the corners. Leave to cool before cutting - refrigerating it makes it much easier to cut.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/Sp7T4sLjPQI/AAAAAAAAAMs/7Go_L8QGnUM/s1600-h/100_2998.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/Sp7T4sLjPQI/AAAAAAAAAMs/7Go_L8QGnUM/s320/100_2998.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5376967976012692738" border="0" /></a>Try not to get addicted!!!!</div>
