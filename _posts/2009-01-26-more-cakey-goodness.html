Well... I was having another trawl through my photos looking for a specific couple of cakes that I am particularly proud of. Unfortunately they are proving elusive, so I'll have to save them for another time, but I did come across a few other photos of cakes and general <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">chocolatey</span> goodness, which will have to do in the meantime!<br /><div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4aMllsbHI/AAAAAAAAAE8/HeKzJ5zD54k/s1600-h/100_6024.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5295699015385246834" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4aMllsbHI/AAAAAAAAAE8/HeKzJ5zD54k/s200/100_6024.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 151px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /></a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4aMQerkoI/AAAAAAAAAE0/T9kohTOEa0c/s1600-h/100_6027.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5295699009718686338" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4aMQerkoI/AAAAAAAAAE0/T9kohTOEa0c/s200/100_6027.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 151px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /></a>So first things first - a couple of shots of a birthday cake I made for a friend who is a keen diver. Don't panic - the 'sand' is brown sugar so there were no unexpected crunchy bits when it was cut and eaten. The royal icing I used for the waves was a little bit too soft, and the "Stormy Breakers" look kind of flopped but I was pretty pleased with the marbled water and rocks.<br /><br />As well as making the snowman cake I posted about below, this year in the run up to Christmas I made a whole bunch of sweets which I then turned into handmade selection boxes for friends and family. I'm still not really tuned in to this business of taking photos as I go, and of the finished item before I <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">inevitably</span> give it to someone as a pressie, but I did get action shots during the making of 2 of the types:<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4eL1ERBfI/AAAAAAAAAFc/N3ZAKvvrwWQ/s1600-h/100_1730.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5295703400406648306" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4eL1ERBfI/AAAAAAAAAFc/N3ZAKvvrwWQ/s200/100_1730.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 95px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 127px;" /></a><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4aNoip9RI/AAAAAAAAAFU/cgf21P4uv6c/s1600-h/100_1735.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5295699033357677842" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4aNoip9RI/AAAAAAAAAFU/cgf21P4uv6c/s200/100_1735.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 97px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 128px;" /></a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4aNQRv9iI/AAAAAAAAAFM/xZytFcKaW2c/s1600-h/100_1739.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5295699026844317218" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4aNQRv9iI/AAAAAAAAAFM/xZytFcKaW2c/s200/100_1739.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 97px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 130px;" /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4aMyTr1_I/AAAAAAAAAFE/WhQwNHtbwWM/s1600-h/100_1740.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5295699018799372274" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4aMyTr1_I/AAAAAAAAAFE/WhQwNHtbwWM/s200/100_1740.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 96px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 128px;" /></a>Firstly I made apricot and marzipan 'hedgehogs' - so nicknamed because of their shape. I used a holly leaf cutter to stamp out the marzipan, which I topped with finely chopped dried apricots and dipped into milk and dark chocolate. I really wanted to give them little white chocolate eyes, but a combination of lack of time, and fear that my friends would think I had finally lost it made me restrain myself. Maybe next time tho...<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4eMEtGHCI/AAAAAAAAAFs/yIjxPrXQHOg/s1600-h/DSC00233.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5295703404604431394" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4eMEtGHCI/AAAAAAAAAFs/yIjxPrXQHOg/s200/DSC00233.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 150px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /></a>Next I blended up <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">madeira</span> cake with dried cranberries and mixed it with butter icing in order to form a pliable doughy consistency. I rolled the mix into little balls, dipped them in really dark chocolate and sprinkled them with finely shredded cranberry strips.<br /><br />Sadly <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">unphotographed</span>, there were also little flowers stamped out of fruitcake and dipped again in dark chocolate, and toffee marshmallow <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">crispies</span>, coated in white chocolate and sprinkled with pink sugar crystals. These got such a good reaction that I'll definitely be making them again, and if I'm <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">lucky</span> will remember to snap some pics along the way!<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SX4aMyTr1_I/AAAAAAAAAFE/WhQwNHtbwWM/s1600-h/100_1740.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><br /></a></div>
