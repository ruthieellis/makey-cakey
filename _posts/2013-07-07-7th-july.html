A divide and conquer day - Mr E dropped myself and Mini-M at the zoo before hitting IKEA for some bookcases.

The face painting queue wasn't too busy as we got there fairly early, so meet Mini-M the panda...<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-07-07-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-07-07-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />
