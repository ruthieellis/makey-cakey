Mini-M is in charge of the photo cataloguing this year. She's got our old camera, and we're aiming for 1 picture for each week.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Soâ€¦ week 1. She directed the staging of this shot, then clicked the shutter - it specifically contains 3 things:</div><div><ol><li>Her new cuddly toy - and don't make the mistake of calling it a deer - it is most definitely a fawn (she'll correct you)</li><li>The new lamp we bought in IKEA to make mealtimes less dingy. She is disproportionately excited by it.</li><li>Mr E's injured finger - week 1 and we've clocked up 2014s first trip to A&amp;E already. I'll not shame him by explaining the specifics, but let's just say not many people could manage to cut themselves on their deodorant!</li></ol><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-01-13-linked-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-01-13-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div><br /></div></div>
