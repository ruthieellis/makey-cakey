Watching the "Great British Bake Off" on TV recently got me thinking about scones - and whether I could do better than some of the contestants, or just whether I thought I could. And then there was some left over haggis in the fridge from the night before's dinner (yes, it's not just a stereotype, Scottish people do eat it regularly at home) and plenty of cheese, which both coincided with a snoozing baby in the sling, and a visit from my sister who lent a helping hand, and so these bad boys were born!<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TKMXAJdrzSI/AAAAAAAAAQY/UJe7YCSnQCY/s1600/100_4870.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TKMXAJdrzSI/AAAAAAAAAQY/UJe7YCSnQCY/s400/100_4870.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5522282859394223394" border="0" /></a><br />We had them buttered with soup for tea and they were lovely - definitely a successful experiment!<br />Here's the recipe I used...<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cheese &amp; Haggis Scones</span> (makes approx 24)<br /><ul><li>500g self-raising flour</li><li>150-200g cheese, grated (I used a mix of strong cheddar, and cheddar with chillies)</li><li>100-150g cooked and cooled haggis</li><li>2 eggs beaten</li><li>100g butter, plus extra for greasing (I reduced the butter quantity from 125g in normal cheese scones, as the haggis has fat in it)</li><li>1.5 tsp baking powder</li><li>300ml milk plus extra for glazing</li><li>Paprika for sprinkling</li></ul>Preheat oven to 200C (fan, or 220C conventional) and grease a couple of baking trays<br />These were made in the food mixer, but could equally be done by hand.<br />Add the flour and baking powder to the mixer and blitz briefly. Put in the butter and pulse until it resembles breadcrumbs. Add the haggis and whiz it together again.<br />Tip the mixture into a bowl and stir in the cheese, then make a well in the centre of the mix and add the beaten eggs and half of the milk. Mix with a knife until the mixture forms a sticky but firm dough. Add more of the milk if required.<br />Bring the mixture together with your hands and tip the dough out onto a floured worktop.<br />Roll out until about 1.5cm thick and cut into rounds. Don't twist the cutter as this will seal the sides and prevent the scone rising properly.<br />Brush with a little more milk and sprinkle with paprika.<br />Bake for about 10 minutes until risen and golden, then cool on a wire rack.<br />Enjoy :o)<br />PS - thanks Lisa for the baking assistance!
