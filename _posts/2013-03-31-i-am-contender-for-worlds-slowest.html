I started knitting a baby pinafore almost a year ago, when we were on our Highland Fling road trip.<br /><div><br /></div><div>On Friday, I finally finished it.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-03-310faf0bf5-large-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-03-31-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Moss stitch close up</td></tr></tbody></table><div>It began life as a baby present, but its intended recipient is almost walking! So now it's a new dress for Mini-M's doll, Tiger. (Or Tiger Felicity Cheerio Ellis to give her full name, but thankfully although she chose it, Mini-M seems to be happy to abbreviate it most of the time.) For a little while, she was determined the doll would be called 'Sister' and I could foresee many embarrassing situations in public where I found myself saying things like... "Stop pushing Sister off the side of the buggy"and "Don't chew Sister's foot" etc.</div><div><br /></div><div>The pattern I used was the <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-03-314b500f4d-large-image-0001.html">Super Simple Baby Tunic by Rebecca Gunn Designs</a>, and even for a moderately incompetent knitter like me, it was fairly easily achievable. I should explain that the reason it took a year is not that I knit at snail's pace, slogging away diligently every evening, but that I do a bit, forget about it for ages, come back to it, realise I have no idea where I was in the pattern, do a lot of counting, working it out, then it's time to go to bed. The next time I feel like knitting, I don't have internet access and can't find the scrap of paper I copied the pattern onto etc etc etc. It's a miracle it ever got finished at all.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-03-31b85ba530-large-image-0002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-03-31-image-0001.JPG" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Tiger modelling her new dress</td></tr></tbody></table><div>And looking at the back of the dress, there's another reason it's only fit for Tiger - there are a few rather glaring mistakes, where I clearly didn't count properly! The thing I hate most about knitting is unpicking, so I have a bad habit of carrying on regardless. My next project has been cast on and is underway, and although I may surprise myself, I think there's a high chance that about this time next year, Tiger will be getting another wardrobe addition...</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-03-317ed77dc1-large-image-0003.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-03-31-image-0002.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Oooooooooooops!</td></tr></tbody></table>
