My folks were on holiday last week, down in Staithes on the North East coast of England. There was an award winning fish monger nearby, and Mum brought us quite a haul of lovely fish back (Thanks!) including some peppered smoked mackerel.<br /><br />Here's how we ate it...<br /><br />We had it on pizza - seriously don't knock it until you've tried it - it was delicious!<br />The pizza base was topped with tomato and basil pizza sauce (from a jar), peppered mackerel, sauteed kale, pickled pears and goats cheese. An unlikely sounding combination, but it really worked. Even better, Mr E made it!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0k8CG8NsKAI/TqHjL-A9z9I/AAAAAAAABhw/rurtzpw4D_s/s1600/101_0622.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0k8CG8NsKAI/TqHjL-A9z9I/AAAAAAAABhw/rurtzpw4D_s/s400/101_0622.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br />And we had it as pate/dip. I was inspired by a recipe for courgette dip in the River Cottage Baby and Toddler Cook Book, which I changed a bit. The original is just courgette, garlic and cream cheese, and would definitely be kid friendly. There's nothing inherently un-kid friendly about my adaptation, just that the mackerel flavour might be too strong for some little tastes.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ahyLoVR1UKI/TqHjQH905RI/AAAAAAAABh4/sbaD1Ma_5WI/s1600/101_0631.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ahyLoVR1UKI/TqHjQH905RI/AAAAAAAABh4/sbaD1Ma_5WI/s400/101_0631.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><b>Courgette and Mackerel Pate/Dip</b> (Serves 2-3 adults for lunch, or 4-5 as a dip)<br /><br /><ul><li>2 small courgettes</li><li>1 clove of garlic</li><li>1 heaped tsp fresh thyme leaves</li><li>1 tbsp olive oil</li><li>25g cream cheese (I used chevre spreadable goats cheese)</li><li>1/2 large or 1 small peppered mackerel fillet</li></ul><br />Heat the oil in a small frying pan, crush the garlic, add and soften for a minute or so.<br />Thinly slice the courgettes and add to the pan. Sprinkle in the thyme.<br />Cook over a very low heat until the courgettes are translucent, but not browned - about 15 mins - stirring occasionally.<br />Either put all the ingredients into a food processor and blitz, or pop them in a jug and give them a whizz with a hand blender.<br />Season with salt and pepper to taste (I didn't add any, since the mackerel was peppered and the cheese salted).<br />Chill for about an hour before serving.<br /><br />We ate it with toasted bread, at the table in the sunshine - pretending it wasn't freezing outside!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XGpbB5BmBFY/TqHjUPBqoLI/AAAAAAAABiA/yw98mqmJIFo/s1600/101_0632.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XGpbB5BmBFY/TqHjUPBqoLI/AAAAAAAABiA/yw98mqmJIFo/s400/101_0632.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>If you wanted to make it a denser pate, you could use a stiffer soft cheese, and also up the cheese and decrease the courgette quotas slightly. The texture of this was spreadable on bread, but also dippable - multipurpose is always good!
