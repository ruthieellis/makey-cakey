Fail! No photo. Bad weather, bad toddler attitude, general non-festive grumpiness. So let's gloss over that and have a moment of 'my hasn't she grown' by looking at Mini-M from my 2011 daily photos (age 17 months). I checked Mr E's from last year - it was of a bit of old mapâ€¦ wasn't sure of the significance, so delved further back for cuteness' sake.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-12-23-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-12-23-image-0000.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></div><br />
