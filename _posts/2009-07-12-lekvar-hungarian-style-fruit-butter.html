Well due to general hectic-ness, I've not posted anything for ages. But I'm back :o) The other week as I was tidying out some kitchen cupboards, I came across a bag of dried pears, a BIG bag of crystallised ginger, and a bag of prunes all approaching their use by within the next few months, and definitely ready to expire before I'd had a chance to use them up in normal baking practices!<div>So after a bit of googling, I came across <a href="http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/fruits/r/lekvar.htm">this recipe for Hungarian Lekvar</a>, which is a dried fruit butter, made with dried apricots or prunes. </div><div>Since I'm a pathological recipe corrupter, I did a bit of modification, and went for prune and dark chocolate butter, to make use of a small bar of Lindt 95% chocolate which was too bitter for me and had even escaped several emergency chocolate cupboard raiding attempts. Inspired by the successful result, I decided to get more experimental and went for spiced pear and ginger, with a vanilla pod, cloves and star anise to add a spicy sweetness.</div><div>So far the concoctions have proved to be a versatile pair, although the prune and chocolate one is possibly a little confused about its identity and is treading a fine line between sweet and savoury. Or perhaps it's just me and my husband that are confused - he's definitely of the sweet camp, but I'm convinced it's a relish/chutney savoury wannabe.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/Slo603uPHRI/AAAAAAAAAL4/EDYo7kFa7us/s1600-h/100_2949.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2009-07-12-image-0000.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5357659386696113426" border="0" /></a><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/Slo60r3-bNI/AAAAAAAAALw/H9GKQyZyBnU/s1600-h/100_2944.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 150px; height: 150px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2009-07-12-image-0001.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5357659383515737298" border="0" /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/Slo6ikQ0YHI/AAAAAAAAALo/zR-XpxpiwiI/s1600-h/100_2935.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 150px; height: 150px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2009-07-12-image-0002.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5357659072234807410" border="0" /></a></div></div><div>Anyway, here's a run down of the situations in which they've been consumed so far...</div><ol><li>Pear and ginger on warm out of the oven scones</li><li>Prune and chocolate on toast (a grown-up Nutella substitute...?)</li><li>Prune and chocolate on venison burgers</li><li>Pear and ginger sandwiched in the middle of a Victoria sponge</li><li>Prune and chocolate stirred into porridge</li><li>And both varieties straight out of the jar on a spoon by the aforementioned husband!</li></ol>
