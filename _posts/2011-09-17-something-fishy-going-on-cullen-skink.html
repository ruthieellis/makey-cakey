So as you may be aware from my<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-09-17408b88b7-large-image-0000.html"> previous post, September's Daring Cooks' Challenge</a> was to make stock, soup and consomme.<br /><br />We eat loads of soup - usually of the non-specific vegetable variety. Which is generally pretty tasty, hot, filling and everything you want it to be. Mr E is also a pretty mean soup maker, particularly if said soup is getting blended, and the ingredients can go in "chunky". He always has some secret ingredient up his sleeve (probably not literally - most of them come from the spice rack) that turns dinner time into an exciting soup flavour guessing game.<br /><br />But I digress! I made several different soups for Daring Cooks: Summer Minestrone, Scotch Broth and Cullen Skink, as well as the consomme which I served with chilli noodles. We were encouraged to share the recipes we'd used, but my post was already pretty epic, mainly because I keep getting sidetracked and writing tangentially, so I didn't but promised to do over my next few blog posts.<br /><br />First up is Cullen Skink. This is a traditional Scottish smoked fish soup originating from the North East of Scotland and also often made with Finnan Haddock - another North Eastern speciality - a particular type of smoked haddock, but since I couldn't find any easily in Edinburgh, I went with using some regular smoked haddock and some hot smoked salmon. I'm also gradually trying to re-intoduce dairy into my diet, but haven't quite worked up to cow's milk yet, so I made it using goat's milk which was delicious.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-09-17b3ca13da-large-image-0001.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-17-image-0000.JPG" width="319" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Cullen Skink</b> (serves 4)<br /><br /><ul><li>1 fillet undyed smoked haddock (mine was about 125g)</li><li>1 fillet hot smoked salmon (again, mine was about 125g)</li><li>350ml goats milk</li><li>1 tbsp olive oil</li><li>Small handful of parsley</li><li>2 small dried bay leaves</li><li>2 small onions, finely chopped</li><li>250g mashed potato (not too smoothly mashed - some bits are good!)</li><li>Water</li><li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li></ul><br />Put the goats milk, bay leaves and stalks from the parsley in a small saucepan.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-09-178213e191-large-image-0002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-17-image-0001.JPG" width="319" /></a></div><br /><br />Add the smoked haddock fillet and bring to a gentle boil. Simmer for about 3 minutes, then remove from the heat and allow to infuse for a further 5-10 minutes.<br />Carefully remove the haddock from the milk with a slotted spoon, and set aside.<br />Strain the milk through a fine sieve to catch the herbs, and get rid of any scum that might have formed.<br />Heat the oil in a larger saucepan, and simmer the onions for 5 minutes until softened and starting to go translucent.<br />Add the strained milk to the cooked onion, along with about another 200ml of water.<br />Next add the mashed potato and stir well until the potato is dissolved and the consistency of the soup has thickened. Add more liquid if need be.<br />Flake the smoked haddock and salmon, keeping any eye out for any small bones that escaped the filleting process, then add to the soup along with the parsley.<br />Bring to a gentle simmer again, and cook for about 5 mins until the fish is warmed through.<br />Ladle into bowls and enjoy the lovely creamy fishy goodness.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-09-17333e4322-large-image-0003.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="319" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-17-image-0002.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br />
