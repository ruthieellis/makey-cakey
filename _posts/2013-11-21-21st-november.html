Christmas parties are on the horizon. Still fairly distant (although Mini-M is informing us on a daily basis that it is going to be Christmas soon) but now we are fully prepared and party-ready with sliver glittery mouse shoes! On a less pretty note, we were in the bathroom and Mini-M wanted to sing Christmas songs. I said no, since it was too early. She then tried to convince me that we had to, because (I quote) "It will help me do my poo, Mummy". I remain unconvinced!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-11-21-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-11-21-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />
