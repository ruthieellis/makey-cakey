A tea picnic underneath the Christmas tree to cheer Mini-M up after a tough day at nursery. Very festive, but made slightly weirder by the fact that our Christmas tree is situated on the top landing, just outside the bathroom door. And we were joined in our picnic by a 3ft wooden otter.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-12-09-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-12-09-image-0000.jpg" width="265" /></a></div><br />
