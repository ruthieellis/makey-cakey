<div style="text-align: left;">Since I can't have dairy at the moment, and don't like soya milk that much (small understatement) I've been looking for alternative milk substitutes. My favourite so far is <a href="http://www.oatly.co.uk/Our-products/Products/Oatly-Healthy-Oat-Enriched/">Oatly Oat Milk</a>. It is lovely and even comes is a very very yummy chocolate flavour. But it's not cheap.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; color: #0000ee;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5576058293694327186" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-02-21-image-0000.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 300px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center; width: 300px;" /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; color: #0000ee;"><br /></span></div><div>And the other day I saw almond milk in a wholefoods shop, which was even less cheap, but the idea sounded nice. So after a bit of googling I decide to give making my own a shot, and I'm glad I did - it is so quick and easy, and definitely a fraction of the cost of buying it.</div><div><br /></div><div>I just took 1/2 a cup of almonds (with the skin on) - i.e. a big handful, 5 dates - i.e. a small handful and a pint of water, put them in the liquidiser, and blended them. I then strained the liquid through muslin set in a sieve, and the resulting liquid is the almond milk. Job done! But left in the muslin was a kind of wet ground almondy daty pulp, that I couldn't bring myself to throw away. </div><div><br /></div><div>So I made cake! Just a regular sponge recipe tweaked to include the almonds.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; color: #0000ee;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5576058298703020450" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-02-21-image-0001.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 300px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" /></span></div><div><br /></div><div>Almond Milk Left-Overs Cake</div><div>2 eggs</div><div>100g butter (or in this case dairy free sunflower margarine)</div><div>100g soft brown sugar</div><div>50g self raising flour</div><div>the almond/date pulp from the almond milk recipe above (about 100g)</div><div><br /></div><div>Option 1) stick it all in the food processor and blitz.</div><div>Option 2) Cream butter and sugar, add eggs with a little bit of the flour and beat, then mix in the rest of the flour and ground almond mixture.</div><div>Pour into a greased 8in (20cm) cake tin and bake at about 180C for about 25 mins.</div><div>I covered mine with ready made chocolate icing, because I was in a hurry, it is dairy free, and tastes nicer than home made dairy-free 'butter' icing! But a proper butter icing with a hint of lemon would also be ace I think!</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; color: #0000ee;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5576058298002441650" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-02-21-image-0002.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 300px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; color: #0000ee;"><br /></span></div>
