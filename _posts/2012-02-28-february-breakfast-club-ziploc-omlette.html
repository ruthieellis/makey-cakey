Since today is the 28th February, and it's been a hectic month, I've been a bit slack with my blogging, and leaving all my challenges to the last minute. I've just blogged my Random Recipes challenge, and now it's on to the <a href="http://fussfreeflavours.com/breakfast-club/">Breakfast Club</a>.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>This challenge is organised by <a href="http://fussfreeflavours.com/">Helen at Fuss Free Flavours</a> - have a look at the challenge archives if you're ever short of breakfast inspiration! And this month it is hosted by <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-02-2852bc31d1-large-image-0002.html">Karen at Lavender and Lovage with the theme of eggs</a>.<br /><br />I'm always intrigued by random sounding cooking methods, and the weirder, the more likely I am to give it a shot. So we eat some odd things in our house from time to time! But often they work out well too - just like my Egg-sperimentation this morning!<br /><br />I had seen the idea of making omelette in plastic ziploc bags &nbsp;a few times, and was intrigued, so decided this was a good excuse to give it a go. The premise is simple - you put all your omelette ingredients into a ziploc bag and then simmer it in a pan of boiling water until it is cooked. I vaguely remember reading some cautionary tales of melting plastic bags, so I went for the thickest bag I could find, and kept the heat low - it worked a dream!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-02-2805da9f34-large-image-0003.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-02-28-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>Now I know, this is not an omelette in the traditional sense, since it's not made in a frying pan, but the end result is closer to an omelette than scrambled eggs, so I'm going with that title!<br /><br /><b>Ziploc Omlette</b> (Serves 1)<br /><br /><ul><li>2 medium eggs</li><li>1 baby sweet pepper</li><li>2 cooked small meatballs</li><li>1 medium ziploc bag</li></ul><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-02-2829917be5-large-image-0004.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-02-28-image-0001.JPG" style="cursor: move;" width="320" /></a></div>Put a medium pan of water on to boil.<br />Chop the pepper and meatballs into small pieces and put them in the ziploc bag. You can chop them on the serving plate to cut down on washing, since neither need to be cooked to be safe.<br />Crack the eggs into the bag.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-02-283d0a8964-large-image-0005.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-02-28-image-0002.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>Seal the top and squish it all up until the egg is 'beaten' and the contents are well mixed.<br />Squeeze out any extra air.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-02-280f7ce855-large-image-0006.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-02-28-image-0003.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>Once the water is boiling, add the bag to the pan and simmer for about 3-4 minutes on each side.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-02-2805318369-large-image-0007.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-02-28-image-0004.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>Take out of the water and allow to cool for a couple of minutes before opening the top of the bad and sliding onto your serving plate.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-02-284870550c-large-image-0008.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-02-28-image-0005.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>I ate mine with a slice of <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-02-28b5280c59-large-image-0009.html">yesterday's cider bread</a> toasted. It worked really well. Minimal mess, since the ziploc goes in the bin. That felt a bit wasteful, however I'm consoling myself that it was already on it's second use, having previously been used to hold scones.<br /><br />This recipe is infinitely customisable to whatever ingredients you like or have to hand. It would also be a quick and easy way to make omelettes with different fillings for different people at once, all ready at the same time, no cross contamination and minimal mess. I've got a feeling it would work on a camping stove too, making a protein packed breakfast without the usual 'burned on egg' issues. Believe me, trying to clean burned on scrambled egg off a stove pan in a stream is not fun!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-02-28121ef97f-large-image-0010.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a></div><br /><script src="http://www.linkytools.com/thumbnail_linky_include.aspx?id=128526" type="text/javascript" ></script>
