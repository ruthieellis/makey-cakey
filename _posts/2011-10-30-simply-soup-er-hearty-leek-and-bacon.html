<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">A quick post of a very quick and easy recipe. Perfect for cold wintry weather, and quick enough to make post-work. And of course dairy free. Mini-M even tried a bit - the leeks were met with skepticism, but the pasta got a big thumbs up!</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-10-308b3b8b44-large-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-30-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Hearty Leek and Bacon Soup</b> (serves 2 as a main course)<br /><br /><ul><li>2 medium leeks</li><li>4 rashers of bacon</li><li>2 handfuls of dried pasta spirals</li><li>1 stock cube (chicken or veg - I used chicken)</li><li>Boiling water</li><li>1/2 tbsp oil (sunflower or light olive oil)</li></ul><br />In a medium saucepan, heat the oil and once hot, snip in the bacon. Fry for a couple of minutes until cooked. Whilst the bacon is frying, clean and slice the leeks, then add to the bacon. Chuck in the pasta too, crumble over the stock cube, and pour over boiling water to cover with a cm or so above.<br /><br />Simmer for about 15-20 mins, until the leeks are soft and pasta cooked.<br /><br />Job done. It's such a simple recipe, uses so few ingredients, and tastes soooooooo much more than the sum of its parts. It's been a revelatory way for us to use leeks, which make frequent appearances in our veg box, and for which I've always been slightly at a loss for inspiration. But no more.... I'm sure this soup or variations thereof will appear frequently all through the winter at No.28.
