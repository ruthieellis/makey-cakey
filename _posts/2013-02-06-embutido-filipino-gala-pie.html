<div>Mr E is on a mission to eat food from 30 different countries in the year before he turns 30. We seem to have been covering Spain and Poland repeatedly, and struggling a bit on other fronts, so I decided to be a little adventurous to help out.</div><div><br /></div><div>Embutido is a Filipino Meatloaf that is stuffed with hard boiled egg - a little like Gala Pie is in the UK, but without the lardy pastry outer.&nbsp;I found my <a href="http://salu-salo.com/embutido-filipino-style-meatloaf/">recipe inspiration here</a>, but as usual didn't have quite the right things, so I'm posting my much less authentic version too!&nbsp;It is supposed to be made with minced pork, but our nearest ASDA (which sometimes seems to be a strong contender for the worst stocked supermarket in Edinburgh...) had no minced pork, so I used turkey.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-unrvua1l5rY/URLYnop3a5I/AAAAAAAAFB8/USq4_mO9mYI/s1600/2013-01-27+17.07.53.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-unrvua1l5rY/URLYnop3a5I/AAAAAAAAFB8/USq4_mO9mYI/s400/2013-01-27+17.07.53.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Meatloaf - hard to photograph beautifully, on your phone, as you're about to eat...</td></tr></tbody></table><div>The dish is apparently traditionally served around Christmas time in the Phillipines - slices of it would make a pretty awesome Christmas morning breakfast!</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Embutido</b> (makes 2 meatloaves, each serving 4-6)</div><div><ul><li>800g turkey mince</li><li>1 slice fresh white bread</li><li>2 tbsp Oatly oat milk</li><li>2 eggs</li><li>1.5 small cooking chorizo (about 100g) chopped</li><li>2 heaped tbsp fruity chutney (I used some M&amp;S Windfall chutney)</li><li>1/4 tsp ground white pepper</li><li>1 onion chopped</li><li>1 tsp salt</li><li>2 tbsp raisins</li><li>2 hard boiled eggs</li><li>2 tbsp dairy free sunflower margarine</li></ul></div><div>Shell the boiled eggs and quarter.</div><div>Preheat the oven to 180C (170C fan)</div><div>Put all the ingredients apart from the margarine and hard boiled eggs into a food processor and blitz until well combined.</div><div>Take a sheet of aluminium foil and use 1 tbsp of the margarine to grease it well.</div><div>Pile half of the mixture across the sheet, leaving space to fold in the ends, in a rectangle.</div><div>Place 4 slices of egg down the middle, then gently pull the sides of the mixture over to cover the egg.</div><div>Wrap the foil all around and make sure the ends are well sealed.</div><div>Repeat with the other half of the mixture, margarine and boiled egg.</div><div>Bake for around 1hr - unwrap and check carefully to see if the juices run clear - if not, rewrap and allow to cook for another 15 mins.</div><div>Rest in the foil for 15 mins before unwrapping and slicing.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fjmK7qmuT-8/URLYoQ2hu_I/AAAAAAAAFCE/XuQ1PSNOL_8/s1600/2013-01-27+16.28.53.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fjmK7qmuT-8/URLYoQ2hu_I/AAAAAAAAFCE/XuQ1PSNOL_8/s400/2013-01-27+16.28.53.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The impatient bit... waiting for it to be ready to open!</td></tr></tbody></table><div>I made the whole mix, and froze one complete cooked meatloaf. This was a really tasty tea and it also made a delicious sandwich filling sliced thinly, because the turkey mince I used was very lean, so even when cold, it didn't feel too fatty.</div><div><br /></div><div>Once we persuaded Mini-M it was just like sausages she was a fan. She's also going through an egg-loving phase at the moment, so as long as we made sure her slice had a big, obvious bit of egg in it, she was happy!</div><div><br /></div><div>I have to say I was slightly skeptical at the inclusion of chutney and raising, but they add a really lovely sweetness and tang to it, which is offset by the pepper and chorizo. The moral of the story is - don't be daunted by the odd ingredients!</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-t6oowiYdxMs/URLYmLLQN0I/AAAAAAAAFB0/OnH1XgIZg9c/s1600/2013-01-27+17.07.48.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-t6oowiYdxMs/URLYmLLQN0I/AAAAAAAAFB0/OnH1XgIZg9c/s400/2013-01-27+17.07.48.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">In the name of using things up, we ate it with baked beans, green beans, plain noodles and cauliflower!
