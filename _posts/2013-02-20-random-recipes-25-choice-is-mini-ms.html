For this month's Random Recipes challenge, hosted as ever by <a href="http://www.belleaukitchen.com/">Dom at Belleau Kitchen</a>, we were allowed to <a href="http://www.belleaukitchen.com/2013/02/random-recipes-25-choice-is-yours.html">choose our random book and random recipe however we pleased</a>.<br /><br />Instead of counting cookbooks and using random number generators which has been used by many participants in the past, I decided that Mini-M was fairly random in general, so she could choose.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1-GW-YyIC6k/USVLLOvCmYI/AAAAAAAAFKg/DpaytrhX06w/s1600/2013-02-18+17.30.46.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-02-20-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 13px;">Hearty food never looks pretty!</td></tr></tbody></table>I asked her to pick a cookbook from Mummy's shelf, and so she did. Surprise surprise, it was 'Fun Cakes'. I exercised my power of veto - no birthdays in February, so no ridiculous cake decorating on the agenda. After a moment of petted lip, and assurances that when it was actually her birthday, she could choose a cake, she went back and picked another - this rather vintage Mary Berry freezer book.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cbhV0Jzd3RM/USVLS74YTII/AAAAAAAAFK0/IxDoo7GX8RE/s1600/2013-02-18+17.36.12.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-02-20-image-0001.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Some rather retro food styling!</td></tr></tbody></table>I opened it part way through, and the recipe I ended up with was Norfolk Hotpot. It's basically a creamy bacon and potato casserole. As usual I played fairly fast and loose with the recipe, for which I have a whole range of excuses.<br /><br />1) I needed to make it dairy free so used Oatly Oat Milk.<br />2) I have no idea what a Knuckle of Forehock of Bacon is. After reading the recipe, there were instructions to remove it from the bone, so I bought the only bit of bacon on a bone that ASDA had - a smoked pork hough. I have no idea if it was the correct size, since there was no weight in the recipe.<br />3) I didn't have the 4hrs cooking time required to do it properly, so I boiled the potatoes for longer, didn't layer them artfully on top, and just gave it a quick stint it into the oven to finish off.<br />4) 450g onions seems an awful lot for 6 people. Based on the onions I had, it worked out at 1 each. I'm not really up for eating a whole onion in a meal, so I halved the amount.<br />5) The bacon was really salty, so I decided not to use the actual stock - an approach condoned by Mary Berry - but she suggests a ham stock cube. I went slightly to the other end of the scale and used low sodium vegan Marigold boullion, since that is what I had to hand.<br /><br />Thankfully despite all of those deviations, the end result was still lovely!<br /><br />So here's my 'loosely inspired by Mary Berry' <b>Almost Norfolk Hotpot</b> (serves 4)<br /><br /><ul><li>1 smoked pork hough</li><li>2 bay leaves</li><li>450g potatoes</li><li>250g onions</li><li>450g vegetable boullion</li><li>150ml Oatly oat milk</li><li>2 tbsp dairy free sunflower margarine</li><li>2 tbsp plain flour</li><li>Pepper</li></ul><br />Soak the hough in cold water for an hour.<br />Drain and replace the water, then bring to the boil.<br />When it is boiling, take off the heat, drain and replace the water.<br />Repeat.<br />When it comes up to the boil again, allow to boil for 2hrs until the meat is tender.<br />Remove the hough, allow to cool slightly, then strip off the meat, and cut away the sinews and fat.<br />Slice the onions.<br />Peel and chop the potatoes into chunks.<br />Put both in a large saucepan of boiling salted water, add the bay leaves and cook until the potatoes are just tender but not too soft.<br />Whilst the potatoes and onion are boiling, melt the butter in a small saucepan.<br />Add the flour and stir well, then cook for a couple of minutes to make a roux.<br />Add the boullion and milk a little at a time, whisking well between additions, to make a smooth sauce.<br />Mix the boiled onion and potatoes, chopped bacon and sauce together in a large casserole.<br />Cook uncovered for 20 mins.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0UgVAWKBe70/USVLKVlXDXI/AAAAAAAAFKY/UhqkFwKu8aA/s1600/2013-02-17+21.18.52.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-02-20-image-0002.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Not for the faint hearted - boiled hough is &nbsp;a little gnarly!</td></tr></tbody></table>This is a great hearty dish for winter weather.
