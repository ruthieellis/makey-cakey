I'm starting off the new year full of blogging enthusiasm and good intentions about joining in some more of the monthly blog challenges out there. Perhaps not every month, but where I can from time to time, and when the themes fit into our meal plans or activities.<br /><br />And I couldn't not join in with the <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2014-01-21c026fae4-large-image-0000.html">Treat Petite</a> challenge, organised jointly by <a href="http://www.cakeyboi.com/">Cakeyboi </a>and <a href="http://www.thebakingexplorer.com/">The Baking Explorer,</a> since the <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2014-01-21938351eb-large-image-0003.html">theme this month is Free From</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-01-21-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-01-21-image-0000.JPG" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><br />I've come up with a sticky rice crispy treat that is gluten and dairy free - and of course delicious. Instead of butter I've used coconut oil, with the 'sticky' provided by melted marshmallows and peanut butter.<br /><br />I made this in bulk for a youth group event, so this recipe does serve a crowd. I cut it into 48 small pieces, and made it in a roasting tin. Unless you're similarly feeding the masses, I'd half it!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-01-21-image-0001.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-01-21-image-0001.jpg" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>Coconut Marshmallow Crispie Slice </b>(48 small pieces in a large roasting tray)<br /><br /><ul><li>100g coconut oil</li><li>400g marshmallows</li><li>200g smooth peanut butter</li><li>100g sultanas</li><li>100g desiccated coconut</li><li>100g puffed rice</li><li>Non-dairy margarine for greasing the tin</li></ul><br />Grease a large roasting tin really really well - line with parchment if you want to make extra sure, as this is very sticky stuff!<br />Put the coconut oil in a very large saucepan (I used my pressure cook pan without the lid) and melt it over a low heat.<br />Add the peanut butter and marshmallows and continue to heat, stirring constantly, until the marshmallows are completely melted.<br />Stir in the rice bubbles, coconut and sultanas as quickly as you can - it will start setting in the pan.<br />Scrape the mixture into the pan and spread out. A good tip, if you've found it has set too quickly to spread, is to cover it with another sheet of parchment and press out to fill the tin to the edges, then peel the parchment back off.<br />Allow to cool completely, then cut into slices.<br />Store in an airtight tin - this will keep for several days.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-01-21-image-0002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-01-21-image-0002.JPG" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><br />This is a really good dairy-free substitution for your typical melted butter/marshmallow/toffee tray bake. The peanut butter and coconut give it loads more flavour and substance than just using marshmallows.<br /><br />I have to admit I found myself wishing there had been a few pieces spare for Mr E and myself, but it's probably best for the January diets that there wasn't, and instead it went to a bunch of enthusiastic teenagers burning off loads of energy!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-01-21-image-0003.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-01-21-image-0003.jpg" height="182" width="200" /></a></div><br />
