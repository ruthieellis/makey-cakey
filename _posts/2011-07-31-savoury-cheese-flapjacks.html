<div style="text-align: left;">A quick recipe post, to share a surprising recent flapjack success.</div><div>I picked up 'The Mornflake Oat Cuisine' recipe book in a discount bookshop for 99p, because mainly I felt sorry for it. A bad habit of mine - pitying books being sold in low-class establishments has led to a surprising number of equally surprising titles appearing on our bookshelves, or being given as gifts.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-67_6K2mB3IM/TjXGnQJTtSI/AAAAAAAABHI/QJ-Eg5-zacU/s320/IMGP4576.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5635628886375249186" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><br /></span></div><div>Flicking through it, I saw a recipe for cheese flapjacks, and my initial reactions was 'eurgh'. However the idea stuck in my mind, and so a couple of weeks ago I decided to give the recipe a shot, and the results were surprisingly very very good.</div><div><br /></div><div>I made these with goats cheese and goats yoghurt so that I could eat them - but I imagine they would be equally nice, if not nicer with cows milk and 'real' cheese. After eating them, I think they would be an excellent toddler snack - the yogurt and cheese pack in lots of calcium, the oats lots of slow release energy, no sugar and portable. Sadly not for Mini-M just yet - she's still a dairy free baby.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N8m13pKg1JU/TjXGnBGNmiI/AAAAAAAABHA/M0ZoNiSamw8/s320/IMGP4575.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5635628882335734306" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><br /></span></div><div><b>Savoury Cheese Flapjacks</b> (makes 16)</div><div><ul><li>225g rolled oats</li><li>100g grated cheese - I used hard goats cheese</li><li>75g margarine - I used soya</li><li>150ml yoghurt - I used goats yoghurt</li><li>1 egg, beaten</li><li>A pinch of black pepper</li></ul></div><div>Preheat oven to 180C (170 fan oven/ 350F/ Gas 4). </div><div>Grease a 23cm/9in cake tin (I used sunflower spray)</div><div>Mix the oats and grated cheese in a large bowl. </div><div>Melt the margarine (microwave or pan is fine), then stir it into the oats and cheese, along with the yoghurt, egg and black pepper.</div><div>Tip into the prepared tin and spread evenly into the corners.</div><div>Bake for 25-30mins until golden brown.</div><div>Remove from the oven and cut into slices, the leave to cool in the tin.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xFc3Hb-kAM4/TjXGnr6f-yI/AAAAAAAABHQ/8oGJc6qlh9Y/s320/IMGP4577.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5635628893829331746" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><br /></span></div><div>We ate some dunked in lettuce, potato and pea soup, and it was great!
