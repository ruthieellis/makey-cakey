As if I don't have enough recipes in my cookbook and recipe cutting stash, I also get cookbooks out of the library. I'm sure Mr E probably wishes I didn't because they just clutter up the living room, since I'm loathe to put them on the bookcase in case they never re-surface, and I rack up epic library fines (speaking from experience here).<br /><br />I've been on a bit of a River Cottage kick recently, which started with the Baby and Toddler cookbook, and has progressed via the family cookbook to River Cottage Every Day, where I found a recipe for Overnight home-cured bacon chops.<br /><br />I've been fairly adventurous in my cooking at times, but I'd never ventured into meat curing - it has always scared me, seemed a lot of hassle, with a high potential for food poisoning. However this recipe made it eminently possible and easy.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend giving it a go - some serious pork alchemy happens overnight in the fridge, and creates bacon-y, sweet, spiced, chops. I changed some of the seasonings, based on what I had to hand - so here is my version.<br /><br /><b>Overnight home-cured bacon chops</b> (serves 4)<br />4 large pork chops (I used boneless ones)<br />2 tbsp sunflower or groundnut oil for frying<br />50g fine sea salt (not table salt, sea salt is milder, sea salt will make it overpoweringly salty)<br />25g light muscovado sugar<br />4 dried bay leaves, crumbled<br />10 allspice berries<br />1/2 tsp ground black pepper<br /><br />In a plastic tupperware box, combine the salt, sugar, bay leaves, allspice and pepper, put the lid on and give it a good shake to mix.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-10-03d184efd4-large-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-03-image-0000.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br />Add the pork, and lightly rub the salt mix in, before putting the lid on, and putting the box in the fridge.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-10-03b8661046-large-image-0001.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-03-image-0001.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br />Leave for at least 12 hrs, and not more than 24hrs.<br />If you remember, shake the box a couple of times, to distribute the cure.<br />After your time is up, take the chops out and rinse them well under running water, then pat dry with kitchen paper.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-10-03bbfd00ad-large-image-0002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-03-image-0002.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br />To cook, heat the oil in a large frying pan, add the chops and cook for about 6 minutes on each side until they are done through.<br /><br />I added a quartered apple and quartered plum to the pan for the last 5 mins or so of cooking, for a fruity touch. Mmmmm.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-10-03bc45b9b3-large-image-0003.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-03-image-0003.JPG" width="400" /></a></div>
