I am as big a fan as the next person of that Scottish delicacy of chips and brown sauce, wrapped up in brown paper from the chippie. But you always, always, always get too many.<br /><br />Last night, our family's dinner menu probably reached a low point of culinary sophistication... I had chips and brown sauce, Mr E had macaroni and ketchup, and Mini-M threw pasta around the room and ate a pancake.<br /><br />I ate half of my chips, and put the other half untouched in a plastic box in the fridge to spend the night. Today I was determined to find a way to use them up - I hate seeing food wasted, but I really didn't want to eat them cold.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-10-0965e72921-large-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-09-image-0000.JPG" width="240" /></a></div><br /><br />And to that end I concocted a frittata for lunch, which was quick, easy, tasty, and didn't taste like it was made of leftover chips!<br /><br /><b>Cold Chip Frittata</b> (Serves 3)<br /><br /><ul><li>1/2 a portion of chip shop chips with brown sauce</li><li>1/2 a medium head of broccoli cut into florets&nbsp;</li><li>1 small onion</li><li>4 eggs</li><li>50ml Oatly oat milk</li><li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li><li>25g goats cheese crumbled</li></ul><br />Heat the oil in a large grill-proof frying pan.<br />Finely chop the onion, add to the pan and soften for a few minutes.<br />Cut the large chips into pieces, and add to the pan once the onion is soft.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-10-0912908db1-large-image-0001.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-09-image-0001.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Zap the broccoli in the microwave for three minutes to soften it slightly, then add to the frying pan with the chips and onion.<br />Beat the eggs and oat milk together, then pour into the pan.<br />Swirl it about to coat the bottom, but don't stir.<br />Turn the heat down to low, and cook for about 5 minutes, then sprinkle over the goats cheese.<br />Pop it under the grill on a medium heat for a few more minutes to finish off the cooking.<br />Enjoy with a crisp salad, to assuage the chip guilt!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-10-09354fdb73-large-image-0002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-09-image-0002.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-10-09dd7e9de8-large-image-0003.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-09-image-0003.JPG" style="cursor: move;" width="240" /></a></div>
