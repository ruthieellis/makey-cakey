Just a quick post to say that we're up and running with the <a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/seasonal-surprise-ingredient-swap.html">Seasonal Surprise Ingredient Swap</a>.<br /><br />14 baking enthusiasts will soon be receiving surprise ingredients through the post from their partners and baking up some delicious seasonal goodies.<br /><br />Of course the interpretation of seasonal is left intentionally vague - it could be Halloween, Bonfire Night, Autumn, Winter, Christmas or any other 'seasonal' event that occurs between now and the end of November!<br /><br />If you're one of the intrepid 14, then you have until the 31st October to make contact with your partner (you should have already received an email with their details in), choose your ingredient and post it to them.<br /><br />You then have until 30th November to bake something using the ingredient you have received - anything you want! - take a photo and either blog about it if you have a blog, or email me the picture if you're not a blogger.<br /><br />So here's the pairings...<br /><br /><a href="http://bakinginfranglais.blogspot.co.uk/">Baking in Franglais</a> with <a href="http://recipe-junkie.blogspot.co.uk/">Recipe Junkie</a><br /><a href="http://www.belleaukitchen.com/">Belleau Kitchen</a> with <a href="http://pleasedonotfeedtheanimals.blogspot.co.uk/">Please Do Not Feed The Animals</a><br /><a href="http://cakecrumbsandcooking.blogspot.co.uk/">Cake Crumbs and Cooking</a> with <a href="http://hellyeahfouringredientrecipes.tumblr.com/">Hell Yeah Four Ingredient Recipes</a><br /><a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk/">Makey-Cakey</a> with <a href="http://cake-cookie-pie.blogspot.co.uk/">What's For Dessert</a><br />Andy and <a href="http://cookingmanu.blogspot.co.uk/">Cooking Manu</a><br />Frances and <a href="http://sweetthingyoumakemyheartsing.blogspot.co.uk/">Let Them Eat Cake</a><br />Chloe and Claire<br /><br />Happy baking!
