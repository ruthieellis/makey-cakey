Continuing the wedding anniversary jaunt, today started with a long lie, a cooked breakfast, and time to lounge and read books - all three very rare occurrences, especially on a Saturday morning! Unfortunately this photos has somehow made Mr E look like he has disproportionately long legs, which isn't true, so on that basis I'm going to claim that it is also a quirk of the camera in yesterday's photo making my front teeth look ridiculously far apart!!!!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-10-19-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-10-19-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />
