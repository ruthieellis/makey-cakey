Chocolate brownies are amazing, but sadly not one of life's superfoods :o(<br />So I decided to try to make 'healthy' brownies, which were both a success and failure.<br />Failure because they were totally un-brownie-like in texture and feel.<br />Success because they tasted pretty good in the end.<br />Instead of using butter (yep, they were completely butter/marge/oil free) I used prune puree which I've already posted about <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2009-08-107bd4d01a-large-image-0000.html">here</a>. And some very roughly ground wholemeal flour which was ground by an old steam engine thing at an agricultural show.<br />I also chucked in some chopped up toffees that were lurking in the cupboard and going soft.<br />So here's a wee pic, no recipe, as I can't remember what I did, but a vague summary follows after the image.<br /><br /><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2009-08-108243bf70-large-image-0001.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2009-08-10-image-0000.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5368449140070895202" border="0" /></a>About 250g prune &amp; chocolate puree<br />100g sugar<br />200g flour<br />3tbsp cocoa powder<br />3 tbsp milk<br />2 eggs<br />1tsp coffee granules<br />100g toffees chopped into little bits<br /><br />Chuck it all in a big bowl and mix well with an electric whisk (except the toffee) - add more milk if needed. Hoy it all into a greased brownie tin, and stick it into a medium oven (about 180C) for about half an hour. It doesn't taste luxurious, but it does taste nice, and feels a lot more virtuous than regular brownies.
