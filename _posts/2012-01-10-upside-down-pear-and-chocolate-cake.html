Pears and chocolate are a delicious combination, and therefore it's not surprise that this cake tasted fantastic. Rich dark and chocolaty with a fruity edge cutting through - perfect. We ate it cold, over several days, as a cake when friends came round to visit, and then just on our own, and it kept really well. It would also be lovely as a pudding, served warm with a splash of cream or scoop of ice cream.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-01-10ecba9b8b-large-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-01-10-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Upside Down Pear and Chocolate Cake (Serves 8 generously)<br /><ul><li>3 tbsp demerara sugar</li><li>3-4 medium sized ripe pears</li><li>200g dairy free dark chocolate broken into pieces</li><li>125g dairy free margarine</li><li>2 eggs</li><li>40g granulated sugar</li><li>125g self raising flour</li><li>25g cocoa powder (make sure it's dairy free - most are)</li></ul>Grease an 8 or 9 inch cake tin and line the base with baking parchment.<br />Preheat the oven to 190C (170C fan).<br />Sprinkle the demerara sugar over the base.<br />Melt the chocolate and margarine separately in the microwave, then mix together and leave to cool slightly whilst you prepare the pears.<br />Peel and core the pears, and slice into quarters, or thinner, depending on the size of your pears vs the size of the tin. You're looking for a layer all over the base.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-01-10a5d653f0-large-image-0001.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-01-10-image-0001.JPG" width="240" /></a></div><br />Add the eggs and sugar to the melted chocolate, then sieve the flour and cocoa powder in on top. Mix well until smooth.<br />Pour the mixture over the pears and give the tin a good wobble to level it out.<br />Bake at 190C (170C fan) for 35-40 mins until just set in the centre.<br />Allow to cool in the tin for 5 mins, then tip out onto your serving dish and carefully peel off the baking parchment.<br />Voila!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-01-101a6a7e27-large-image-0002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-01-10-image-0002.JPG" width="300" /></a></div>
