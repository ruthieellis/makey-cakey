Sunshine :o) Much excitement because the outdoor grass sculpture at the Gallery of Modern Art wasn't closed due to high winds this time. Happy days. A small moment of two of dissent as Mini-M really wanted to run, and the sign said no running. She eventually conceded that she didn't really want to end up cold, wet and soggy after falling in, and that was one of the likely consequences of running.<br />Unrelatedly on the way there in the car, Mini-M pointed out the window and exclaimed that she could see "a pigeon sky party" after a large flock of them took off together. What a great description - life would sound much more exciting if everyone used vocabulary like toddlers doâ€¦<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-02-03-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-02-03-image-0000.JPG" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><br />
