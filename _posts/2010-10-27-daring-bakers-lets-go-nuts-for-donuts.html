The October 2010 Daring Bakers challenge was hosted by Lori of <a href="http://butterme-up.blogspot.com/">Butter Me Up</a>. Lori chose to challenge <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">DBers</span> to make doughnuts. She used several sources for her recipes including Alton Brown, Nancy <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Silverton</span>, Kate <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Neumann</span> and <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Epicurious</span>.<br /><br />I was really organised this month, and completing the Daring Bakers challenge was not a last minute affair. I'm even writing this post a couple of hours in advance - what is the world coming to!<br /><br />Since all the donut recipes made 20+ donuts/holes, and they are most definitely best eaten fresh, we decided to have a donut party, and invited a bunch of our friends around on 10/10/10 to celebrate the funky date, and to eat many donuts. A ridiculous amount in fact, <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">because</span> in the morning, my better half was concerned that we'd not have enough - so I made up another batch of dough - and all in all fried about 60 donuts and holes. Which was quite epic, but after it all, there were only 2 left. Our friends have an amazing capacity for demolishing cake!<br /><br />I went for the Alton Brown recipe for the filled yeast donuts, and they were filled with...<br /><div style="text-align: center;">Blackberry and Apple Compote<br /></div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TMc_fCpnceI/AAAAAAAAAQo/i42adjogrS8/s1600/100_4980.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TMc_fCpnceI/AAAAAAAAAQo/i42adjogrS8/s320/100_4980.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5532460469767860706" border="0" /></a><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Dulce <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">de</span> <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">Leche</span><br /></div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TMc_fZNaL5I/AAAAAAAAAQw/sSvDrOofIKo/s1600/100_4971.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TMc_fZNaL5I/AAAAAAAAAQw/sSvDrOofIKo/s320/100_4971.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5532460475823566738" border="0" /></a><br /><div style="text-align: center;">and Lemon Curd (not <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">pictured</span> but you can imagine it)<br /></div><br />I then used the buttermilk donut which I massively corrupted due to my lack of correct ingredients... I subbed regular milk and lemon juice for buttermilk, peach <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">yoghurt</span> for soured cream, and added a finely grated pear.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TMc_gaYfP-I/AAAAAAAAAQ4/qjglDqNucdk/s1600/100_4962.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TMc_gaYfP-I/AAAAAAAAAQ4/qjglDqNucdk/s320/100_4962.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5532460493318340578" border="0" /></a><br />Both doughs were ridiculously sticky to work with, <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">particularly</span> early on in the 'kneading' process which started off a lot more like swirling your hands around in super goop.  But with a wee bit of extra flour added, they both came together fine.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TMc_gxdG_TI/AAAAAAAAARI/yQzlyzy6G-4/s1600/100_4974.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TMc_gxdG_TI/AAAAAAAAARI/yQzlyzy6G-4/s320/100_4974.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5532460499511737650" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The end result were achieved through a serious tag team effort - the prep of the dough was done on rotation between me and my other half, as we both took turns to feed/wind/change baby Martha too. And once I started frying, Terri, Claire and Emma were a dream team on the filling and sugaring.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TMc_gkNUajI/AAAAAAAAARA/1nVxPYNbY-I/s1600/100_4977.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TMc_gkNUajI/AAAAAAAAARA/1nVxPYNbY-I/s320/100_4977.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5532460495955847730" border="0" /></a><br />All types were dusted with a mix of caster sugar, icing sugar and cinnamon, and all tasted yum; I can vouch for this by the fact that I only got 1!<br /><br />Frying the donuts was nowhere near as scary as I thought it would be, and thankfully all went without mishap - and given that they literally spent seconds in the hot oil, we all managed to convince ourselves that they weren't actually that unhealthy...
