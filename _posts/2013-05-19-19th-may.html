Today really was lovely May weather - once the mist had finally burned off by about 3:30pm!

Worth the 05:50am start. <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-05-19-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"> <img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-05-19-image-0000.jpg" width="400" /> </a> </div>
