<p>Today there was sunshine! (And rain but we're glossing over that). So today's photo was taken in proper daylight - a rarity so far this year. Mini-M is fascinated by headphones. Tonight we listened to some Cat Empire and Indigo Girls. She enjoyed having a little boogie to the music :-)</p><div class='separator' style='clear: both; text-align: center;'> <a href='http://lh6.ggpht.com/-UllJk8fQumU/UWsfX8TvXOI/AAAAAAAAFoo/3lwHhq8B1IE/s1600/20130414_185435.jpg' imageanchor='1' style='margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;'> <img border='0' src='http://lh6.ggpht.com/-UllJk8fQumU/UWsfX8TvXOI/AAAAAAAAFoo/3lwHhq8B1IE/s640/20130414_185435.jpg' /> </a> </div>
