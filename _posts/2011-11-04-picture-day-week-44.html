Since it's 10:44pm by my computer clock, and I'm feeling sleepy, here are this weeks photos, minus the preamble! Several of them stolen from other people this week<br /><br /><b>Saturday 29th October</b><br />We were all at the Borders Exploration Group 20th Anniversary Dinner. Mini-M doing the Gay Gordons in her pyjamas! Her first proper ceilidh dance, rather than just getting carried around. She LOVED it - and so did everyone that was watching. Taken by Grandad A.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-11-045e6afa16-large-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-11-04-image-0000.JPG" width="267" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><b>Sunday 30th October</b><br />A quick pre-concert rehearsal before performing at the Hawick Music Club. Taken by Grandad A again, since I was also playing (invisibly). I'm impressed by my brother's multi-tasking skills...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-11-04bd440460-large-image-0001.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-11-04-image-0001.JPG" width="267" /></a></div><br /><b>Monday 31st October</b><br />After over a year of never quite getting round to it, Mr E finally found the time (life has been pretty busy!), and we now have our levitating bedside book shelves installed.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-11-04585456bc-large-image-0002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-11-04-image-0002.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>Tuesday 1st November</b><br />Halloween - not that we did anything spooky. Uncle P came round to visit, and entertained Mini-M on the bottom step of the stairs - the book reading location of choice!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-11-041fa3696b-large-image-0003.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-11-04-image-0003.JPG" width="225" /></a></div><br /><b>Wednesday 2nd November</b><br />Mr E went to ASDA and in true hunter gatherer mode, brought back reduced for quick sale bakery products.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-11-04547881fb-large-image-0004.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-11-04-image-0004.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><b>Thursday 3rd November</b><br />This one was taken by Mr E, but for me, apparently (unintentional rhyming). Today, he unpacked the living room unit, cleaned it and put it back in a more logical formation - i.e. nothing in the bit that Mini-M can easily reach, and lots more stuff on top of it!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-11-0417c67782-large-image-0005.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-11-04-image-0005.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>Friday 4th November</b><br />Mini-M modelling her almost-a-week-late-but-only-just-finished Halloween costume. She is a Mummy (in case anyone thought she just had bad eczema and had to wear lots of bandages). On the plus side, the costume was free, using a bunch of old youth group training bandages and an old babygrow. On the downside, it possibly wasn't my brightest idea to use a too-small babygrow as the base - not sure that the capri-Mummy look will catch on!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-11-046a17fed9-large-image-0006.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-11-04-image-0006.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>And now it's 23:17 and I'm off to bed!
