Today we had flapjack for pudding. With candles in it. Because I couldn't think of a good reason why not when Mini-M asked for them (the candles that is - the flapjack was always part of the plan!). She sang happy birthday to us all for good measure.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-09-25-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-09-25-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div>
