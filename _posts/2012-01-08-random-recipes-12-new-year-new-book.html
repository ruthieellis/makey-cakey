This month's <a href="http://belleaukitchen.blogspot.com/2012/01/random-recipes-12-new-year-new-book.html">Random Recipe challenge</a> was to cook something randomly selected from our newest cook book. A great idea - thanks for yet another ingenious challenge - hosted by the ever inspiring <a href="http://belleaukitchen.blogspot.com/">Dom at Belleau Kitchen</a>.<br /><br />He surmised that most people would have been given one if not more recipe books for Christmas - and he wasn't wrong. I was lucky to receive a copy of Hugh Fearnely Whittingstall's Veg Every Day, which I had been eyeing up when it was released in the Autumn.<br /><br />I flicked through the pages, Mr E shouted 'Stop' and so, the random recipe was chosen - "Pasta with raw tomato". Dairy free in it's original form, and requiring no substitution - win!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4vzbw0mMBCc/TwoP61b3swI/AAAAAAAACO8/s3oQAoqgB28/s1600/100_0495.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-01-08-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />I followed the recipe fairly with only a couple of very minor substitutions: half a green chili for half a red; 100ml extra virgin olive/rapeseed oil for 50ml cold pressed rapeseed oil; posh pasta (orechiette or conchigliette are recommended) for regular - fusilli in this case; and 2 large caper berries finely chopped rather than 1tbsp baby capers. All in all, fairly true to the original!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EEocdVdwJuY/TwoPyLo3GLI/AAAAAAAACOs/ZEwY8rFR2lQ/s1600/07012012115.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-01-08-image-0001.JPG" width="225" /></a></div><br />It was delicious - it tasted of summer, which is sometimes a welcome change in the depths of Scottish winter! The basil was grassy and herby, the garlic packed a punch, and the tomato was sweet and fruity, with a slight salty tang from the capers. It was also excellent cold for lunch the next day - even Mini-M who is notoriously fussy ate some!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7SVB7rfoRXk/TwoP0vRncHI/AAAAAAAACO0/rLD5a9uz5_o/s1600/07012012116.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-01-08-image-0002.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />Peeling the tomatoes was a bit of a pain, but not too difficult, so it's definitely one I'd make again, maybe during the summer when they are a bit more ripe and flavoursome.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iA5jRWYD8qI/TwoQAq632jI/AAAAAAAACPE/gcKUfUpZnzo/s1600/100_0496.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-01-08-image-0003.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://belleaukitchen.blogspot.com/2012/01/random-recipes-12-new-year-new-book.html"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-01-08-image-0004.jpg" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br />
