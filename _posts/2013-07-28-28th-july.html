King Tiso Bear - modelling some of the many new bear (and bunny) clothes we got Mini-M for her birthday (a second hand job lot - eBay rules!).<br />We've had about 2hrs playing out of it already, and Tiso Bear has been dressed as a chef, a king, a magician, a rugby player, a golfer, in hawaiian beach gear and on a skateboard!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-07-28-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-07-28-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div>
