Met a friend after they finished work in town, which meant I was able to have a quick trip to Real Foods which used to me my lunch break distraction several times a week when I worked just around the corner. It's such an brilliant shop - I could spend hours there, just looking in curiosity and awe at all of the things they stock (and most likely purchasing a selection of random dairy-free chocolate and tofu based products!)<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-11-26-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-11-26-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />
