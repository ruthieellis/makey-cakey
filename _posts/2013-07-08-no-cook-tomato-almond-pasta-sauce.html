* Update - in the time that it took me to write this post which admittedly is 24hrs, someone else has posted first, so any residual feelings of hosting / first posting guilt can be forgotten ;-)<br /><br />If you pop by my blog from time to time you might have seen that I'm hosting this month's <a href="http://www.tinnedtomatoes.com/p/pasta-please.html">Pasta Please</a> challenge, and my chosen theme is <a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/pasta-please-cheeseless-wonders.html">Cheeseless Wonders</a>. It's a monthly pasta themed blog challenge organised by <a href="http://www.tinnedtomatoes.com/">Jac at Tinned Tomatoes</a>.<br /><br />I have to confess I'm feeling slightly guilty about being both the host, and the first person to post to join in via the Linky, but we're a week into the challenge now, so I don't think I'm abusing my powers too much ;-)<br /><br />I'm also very much hoping that come the end of the month, I won't end up being the only person to have participated!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JFr7ZEJnHxA/Udq0iI2s99I/AAAAAAAAGOo/KYtc46spLiQ/s1600/DSC00791.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-07-08-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />So my cheese-free entry is for No-Cook Tomato and Almond Pasta Sauce which was inspired by the Internet in general, then I went freestyle, and even left the laptop in the kitchen whilst I made it - no recipe other than the back of an envelope where I jotted down the things I was adding as I went along.<br /><br /><b>No-Cook Tomato and Almond Pasta Sauce </b>(makes enough sauce for 2-3 servings)<br /><br /><ul><li>4 halves of sundried tomato (the dry sort, not in oil)</li><li>8 cherry tomatoes</li><li>12 almonds (skin on)</li><li>2 tbsp olive oil</li><li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li><li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li><li>2 tbsp boiling water</li><li>Salt and pepper to taste</li></ul><br />Roughly chop the sundried tomatoes and put into a jug that you can fit a magic wand (or immersion blender) in. Add the boiling water and leave for 5 mins.<br />Add the almonds, give a mix, and leave for another 5 mins.<br />Put all of the other ingredients into the jug, then carefully blend - go gently at first, otherwise you risk almonds flying out across your kitchen, or tomato explosions!<br />Keep blitzing until smooth and silky - you might need to add a little more water to loosen it up if it starting to get too thick - I added another 2 tbps - this will depend on the size and juiciness of your tomatoes.<br /><br />Stir through hot cooked and drained pasta and you're ready to go. Mr E and I ate ours with a sprinkling of chopped black olive which went really well. Mini-M had hers just with pasta and sauce. There was a moment when we thought she was going to be unusually adventurous and try an olive, but retrospectively, I think she was probably just concerned she might be missing out on raisins, and once she had satisfied herself that wasn't the case, all curiosity disappeared.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OCEhpCBE4n4/Udq0bGb4S3I/AAAAAAAAGOY/yIw9kXmDkbk/s1600/DSC00793.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-07-08-image-0001.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Mini-M was keen that I took a photo of hers too...</td></tr></tbody></table>This is a really lovely pasta sauce - the sundried tomatoes give it a good depth of flavour, and the almonds work really well with the smoked paprika. It's also seriously low effort, which is always a winner chez Makey-Cakey! It would make a great dip for tortilla crisps or the like, if you left it a little thicker too.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CZa3NYsPP6Y/Udq0mpFMShI/AAAAAAAAGOw/mbgcUgc1uS4/s1600/DSC00794.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-07-08-image-0002.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />See - cheese-free isn't so bad!?!? Come on people - get your pasta on and join in!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i91rDhXEfmc/Udq1WllX3EI/AAAAAAAAGO4/G5tx_wieqRo/s1600/pasta+please.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="142" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-07-08-image-0003.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br />
