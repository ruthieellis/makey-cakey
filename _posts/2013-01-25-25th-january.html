<p>Happy Burns Night! I hope you had haggis for your tea - we did - yum! Today's picture isn't of haggis. It's of some rather obstructive parking encountered on the way to work. I think this car started off 'parked' in it's driveway without the handbrake on and it then rolled slowly across the road until the roadworks stopped it! U turns were required all round - although thankfully I wasn't driving otherwise we'dprobably still be stuck there...</p><div class='separator' style='clear: both; text-align: center;'> <a href='http://lh5.ggpht.com/-gayIoPVJoZA/UQLGFrK4DzI/AAAAAAAAE8A/9tBg__vVvAw/s1600/20130125_080218.jpg' imageanchor='1' style='margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;'> <img border='0' src='http://lh5.ggpht.com/-gayIoPVJoZA/UQLGFrK4DzI/AAAAAAAAE8A/9tBg__vVvAw/s640/20130125_080218.jpg' /> </a> </div>
