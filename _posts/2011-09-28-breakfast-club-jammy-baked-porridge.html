For a whole now I've been aware of the '<a href="http://fussfreeflavours.com/breakfast-club/">Breakfast Club</a>' blogging group. Their tag-line is 'Because breakfast should be more interesting than tea &amp; toast or coffee and cereal'. I've had good intentions to participate on several occasions, and always missed the deadline, but this month I have made it by the skin of my teeth - yay!<br /><br />The theme this month is Conserves, and it is hosted by <a href="http://dinnerrecipesguide.com/breakfast-club-15-marmalades-jams-honeys-spreads/">Sonia's Kitchen</a>.<br /><br />Earlier in the summer I made a batch of gooseberry jam with a hint of ginger, and could hear it sitting in the cupboard, crying out the be used in something breakfasty (yes, really. Obviously I hear my ingredients talking to me...)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-otfJrEm9ZIs/ToOTjRCw0WI/AAAAAAAABYg/vYYEVBIz7LE/s1600/100_9493.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-28-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />Here it is, mid-boil back in July. I found 4 packs of ruby gooseberries reduced to 20p in the supermarket and couldn't resist snapping them up for some jam.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZMrUAkpHWTo/ToOUDbpbBaI/AAAAAAAABYk/fSCy-g51FDk/s1600/101_0271.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-28-image-0001.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br />And here it is today - on a spoon enjoying some uncharacteristically warm September sunshine that was streaming in through our living room all day.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CAS0t-hpyUc/ToOUGuvGyBI/AAAAAAAABYo/m07RLw8msts/s1600/101_0272.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-28-image-0002.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />I decided to incorporate it into a baked porridge. Apart from the jam it has no other sugar, so is even pretty healthy, which is a bonus, and it tastes great to boot.<br /><br /><b>Jammy Baked Porridge</b><br />(Serves 2-3)<br /><br /><ul><li>1 cup rolled oats</li><li>3/4 cup milk - I used Oatly oat milk</li><li>2 heaped tbsp jam of your choice - I used the gooseberry with ginger featured above</li><li>1 small banana</li><li>1 egg</li><li>1 heaped tbsp ground flax seed - mine had goji berries in it, purely because I had a random free sample of it lying about - regular stuff would work fine, or bran.</li><li>1/2 tsp spice of your choice - I used grated fresh ginger to bring out the ginger in the jam</li></ul><br />Lightly grease a small casserole dish, and preheat the oven to 180C (160C Fan)<br />Mash the banana in the bottom of a medium mixing bowl.<br />Add the eggs and beat with a fork.<br />Mix in the milk and jam.<br />Add the oats, flax seeds and spice and mix thoroughly until well combined.<br />Pour the mixture into the prepared dish, and bake for about half an hour until firmed to the touch, and browned on top.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Fb_x6FS6MvA/ToOUMXcVbDI/AAAAAAAABYs/1NngmyWTm0c/s1600/101_0273.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-28-image-0003.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>Allow to cool a little before serving and enjoy it as it is, or with extra milk (coconut in this case!) and a drizzle of honey.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-495pJw_nIVw/ToOUPDxFT9I/AAAAAAAABYw/ZOmCAzv6NUY/s1600/101_0280.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-28-image-0004.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>A breakfast to keep you going all day :o)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-28-image-0005.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-09-28-image-0005.gif" /></a></div><br />
