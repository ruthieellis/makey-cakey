It's the official end of the Edinburgh Festival today - and that's including the arty posh bit, and not just the crazy Fringe.<br /><br />To say August has been a busy month would be a fairly massive understatement - but since today is September, it's a new month, and I'm taking advantage of a momentary pause in the craziness this evening to write a blog post (or maybe even two, if I'm still awake later on!).<br /><br />Back at the start of the Festival, Mr E and I went to see <a href="http://bakingjames.co.uk/">James Morton</a> (of Great British Bake Off fame) at the Assembly Rooms do a show about bread, and indeed bake bread during it. It was a slightly random format, but a fun way to spend a lunchtime nonetheless and very interesting (although I'm still no further on as to why so many bread-machine recipes need milk powder in them, and I'm not sure I managed to convince the slightly shocked bread purists all round that I don't actually own one of said bread machines! Just that I know several people who do, and I can't eat dairy, hence I can never eat the bread they bake - hence the question - but it shall remain a mystery for another day).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nDK77km3dzg/UiOa1hFbR0I/AAAAAAAAGkw/DAZHp_I-rww/s1600/DSC01316.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-09-01-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Naan - not exactly!</td></tr></tbody></table>A couple of nights later, Mr E and I decided it was time to give some bread making ago, however we were so engrossed in discussing which of the recommen<span style="text-align: center;">ded kneading techniques were least likely to wake our 3yr old daughter sleeping in the room directly above the kitchen (I kid you not, we lead a rock and roll lifestyle!) that neither of us were paying very close attention to the ingredients and forgot to put in the yeast. Which is a) a rather fundamental problem when making bread, and b) fairly shameful, since there were actually only 3 other ingredients, so it's not like we had a lot to remember.</span><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oxy_fFQ5Jwk/UiOa3cjow7I/AAAAAAAAGk4/vtzvJcj3wWk/s1600/DSC01317.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-09-01-image-0001.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">There really are no words...</td></tr></tbody></table>We did momentarily debate whether or not you could retrospectively knead the yeast in and quickly concluded that was a monumentally stupid idea (almost as stupid as missing it out in the first place) but decided that rather than chucking it straight in the bin, in the spirit of waste-not-want-not we'd see if we could dry fry them to make some flatbreads.<br /><br />It worked surprisingly well - they were dry fried for a couple of minutes on a high heat on each side, then chucked straight in the toaster which made them puff up more than just using the pan on its own.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-juDjCFbn1kE/UiOahB9z10I/AAAAAAAAGkg/3peZk7Wj0hI/s1600/DSC01313.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-09-01-image-0002.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Mini-M perfecting the dough dropping splat</td></tr></tbody></table>We didn't use all the dough, wrapped some in clingfilm and stuck it in the fridge, cue much fun for Mini-M the next day, squdging, stretching and playing with the dough, and choosing the next one to go into the pan each time, to go with soup for dinner.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PDRVunuRUCw/UiOaqCxiFDI/AAAAAAAAGko/xbq4DolJEik/s1600/DSC01314.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-09-01-image-0003.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Another one about to be splatted from on high</td></tr></tbody></table>Disaster averted - however next time I'll not be forgetting the yeast - and I can see just how foolproof James' bread recipe, since clearly my fool quotient is fairly high!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6KIeKa87dMc/UiOafsyazcI/AAAAAAAAGkY/_qtkk-4Qkb0/s1600/DSC01315.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-09-01-image-0004.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Yep - still very flat!</td></tr></tbody></table>
