Jings - we're into double figures of December already, and my last post was 9 days ago, about dumped mattresses which really doesn't seem particularly festiveâ€¦<br /><br />Time to remedy that, and quickly! In three minutes to be precise.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2gmyqxN7nCc/UqeNEGscTHI/AAAAAAAAHUE/9-Sq72cbDXM/s1600/DSC02493.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2gmyqxN7nCc/UqeNEGscTHI/AAAAAAAAHUE/9-Sq72cbDXM/s400/DSC02493.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />Mulled Plums - wintry, warm and delicious, and ready in 3 minutes. What's not to like! It's also a great way to use up those supermarket plums that never ripen. My plum culprits were I believe of the Angeleno variety - presumably favoured by supermarkets because they are completely immune to temperature, bruising, handling, stacking, storage and are pretty much indestructible - and unfortunately often fairly tasteless.<br /><br /><b>3 Minute Mulled Plums</b> (serves 3 to go along with yoghurt or custard)<br /><ul><li>2 or 3 hard plums, depending on size</li><li>1 tbsp runny honey</li><li>1 tbsp Ribena or other fruit cordial</li><li>2 tbsp water</li><li>1/2 tsp ground mixed spice</li></ul>Wash the plums then halve them and remove the stones, then quarter each half.<br />Put in a microwavable bowl with all the other ingredients.<br />Give them a quick stir, then cover and microwave for a minute and half.<br />Stir again, then pop them back in for another minute and a half.<br />Done!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FcNoco7k6NM/UqeNBSLMsfI/AAAAAAAAHT8/AViM_m8CoxE/s1600/DSC02492.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FcNoco7k6NM/UqeNBSLMsfI/AAAAAAAAHT8/AViM_m8CoxE/s400/DSC02492.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">If you like, decant to a bowl that they did not boil over in before serving, for a more sophisticated look...</td></tr></tbody></table>
