Tonight it has been the Great British Bake Off Final - a nail biting finish, and what a monumental final challenge - 6 hrs to make and ice a 3 tier wedding cake. I have made 2 three tier wedding cakes, and I think it probably too me a lot closer to 6 days rather than 6 hours. Mind you that's probably why those guys are in the GBBO final, and I'm not ;-)<br /><br />So to counteract their 3 tiered triumphs, I'm posting something at the opposite end of the sophistication scale. For that sake of alliteration, I'm calling it Toddler Trifle Tart. Mini-M was heavily involved in the making of it and we had it for pudding when Uncle P and Auntie P came round for tea on Sunday. (Apologies - that was a little accidentally rhyme-y).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ALvBON6QR54/UmbffGFPv2I/AAAAAAAAG8A/Gv4t9JD1pe4/s1600/DSC02191.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ALvBON6QR54/UmbffGFPv2I/AAAAAAAAG8A/Gv4t9JD1pe4/s400/DSC02191.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Last minute sprinkle sprinkling</td></tr></tbody></table>This is unashamedly unsophisticated, and really more of an assembly of ready made ingredients than any triumph of home baking. But it did taste nice, and Mini-M was very proud of her efforts.<br /><br /><b>Toddler Trifle Tart</b> (serves 6-8)<br /><br /><ul><li>1 ready made sponge flan case (quite a few brands are dairy free, since they are a very dry sponge - check the ingredients)</li><li>1/2 block strawberry jelly</li><li>1 tin peach slices in juice</li><li>1/2 carton soya custard</li><li>4 tbsp plain soya yoghurt</li><li>1 tbsp icing sugar (we used strawberry flavour Silver Spoon)</li><li>Sprinkles</li></ul><br />Place your flan case onto your chosen serving dish.<br />Make up the jelly according to the packed instructions (remember to half the liquid quantities too).<br />Pour the jelly all over the flan case (it will soak in) and chill for a couple of hours until it has set.<br />Drain the peach slices well, and arrange them all over the jelly soaked flan case.<br />Dollop the custard on top, and spread out a little.<br />Mix together the yoghurt and icing sugar and drizzle over the top.<br />Refrigerate until you are ready to eat, then sprinkle with the sprinkles (!) just before serving.<br /><br />Obviously, if you don't need to keep the finished tart dairy free, then use thick regular custard and whipped cream on top, and it will probably end up being slightly less sloppy!<br /><br />
