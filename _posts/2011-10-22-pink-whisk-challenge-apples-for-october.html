The other night I was watching TV and it was a 'where are they now' run down of last year's competitors in the Great British Bake Off. That prompted me to stop by the blogs of a few of the participants, which I do from time to time - it's nice to read some lovely blogs from closer to home as well as all of those from around the world that I cast and eye over.<div><br /></div><div>One of which is <a href="http://www.thepinkwhisk.co.uk/">The Pink Whisk</a>, by Ruth Clemens, last year's runner-up. When I stopped by, not only had the site had a fab makeover, Ruth had just announced the first <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-10-22a29e8e66-large-image-0001.html">Pink Whisk Baking Challenge</a>, which was to incorporate apples in a recipe. And you know I'm a sucker for a challenge ;o)</div><div><br /></div><div>I made 'Orchard Cider Butter' based on a recipe for Apple Cider Butter in the <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/rivecott-21/detail/0747595321">River Cottage Handbook No. 2 (Preserves) by Pam Corbin</a>. Here's my version - the taste makes the mental arithmetic involved in making well worth it!</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-10-22cb90a649-large-image-0003.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-22-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div></div><div><br /></div><div><b>Orchard Cider Butter</b> (Makes 5x250g jars plus some left over to use straight away)</div><div><ul><li>500g hard pears</li><li>1kg apples&nbsp;</li><li>500ml apple cider with blackberries</li><li>700ml water</li><li>1/2 tsp ground cloves</li><li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li><li>Granulated sugar (about 900g)</li></ul></div><div>Take the stalks off the apples and pears and cut them into chunks. Don't bother peeling or coring them.</div><div>Put the apples and pears into a large pan with the cider and water, bring up to a gentle boil, and cook until the fruit is really soft - this took me about an hour, but it will depend of the type of apples and ripeness of pears you are using.&nbsp;</div><div>Once soft, blitz the mixture with a hand blender, then pass it through a sieve to catch any fibrous bits like pips and cores.&nbsp;</div><div>Weigh the combine weight of your sieved puree and bowl, then tip it back into the pan, and weight the bowl on its own.&nbsp;</div><div>Subtract the weight of the bowl from the combined, and you're left with the weight of puree.</div><div>For each 600g of puree you have, add 340g of sugar, then add the ground cloves and cinnamon.</div><div>Put back on the heat and heat very slowly until all the sugar has dissolved and you can't feel any more graininess.</div><div>Once the sugar has dissolved, turn the heat up to medium high and bring it up to the boil, then let it boil hard for 10-15 minutes until the mixture starts to thicken a little, and sputter. (Mine sputtered like crazy - all over the hob, the splash back, and the oils and vinegars next to the cooker - it's feisty stuff!)</div><div>Take off the heat and pour into warm sterilised jars and seal immediately. Don't be tempted to boil it for too long - it will set in the jars as apples are high in pectin</div><div>Small jars are best, as once opened the butter needs to be kept in the fridge and used within about a month.&nbsp;</div><div>Unopened though, it will keep for a year, so you can enjoy spiced apple-y pear-y cider-y goodness whatever the season.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-10-22f4be1d40-large-image-0004.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-22-image-0001.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div></div><div><br /></div><div>Unfortunately I don't have a lovely picture of the finished butter spread photogenically on a scone, or even some crusty bread. It has been sampled though, and it is delicious, but I sampled it at 7:30am this morning, on a piece of very crumbly not quite toasted toast, served on the least photogenic saucer in the world, which I took back to bed with me, accompanied by a Berocca and some Sudafed to try to banish the lovely cold Mini-M shared with both me and Mr E. Not very photogenic. But it did the trick, and by 9am I was feeling human again - I'm putting the success down to the magic restorative properties of Orchard Cider Butter. If that's not a good reason to go out and make it, then I don't know what is!</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-10-22a29e8e66-large-image-0001.html"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-22-image-0002.png" /></a></div><div><br /></div>
