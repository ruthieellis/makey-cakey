We've been trying to join in with Advent Challenge 2013 via the <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-12-10-linked-image-0000.html">Faye Brown Designs blog</a>.<br />Each day in December up until Christmas, there is a different festive theme to do something creative with. On 10th December we were in fact playing catch up for the 8th December, whose theme was "Your favourite Christmas song" which in Mini-M's case is Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. So we made these reindeer faces. I have to say that it does look suspiciously like there has been a lot of reindeer marrying their cousins (!) in the Rudolph family tree, and to be honest, several may be alien impostor reindeer. They were lots of fun to make though.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-12-10-linked-image-0001.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-12-10-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />
