Last night tea was a bit fragmented in our house. And without wanting to start the whole tea vs dinner vs supper debate, for us tea is our main meal, eaten in the evening at about 6pm. Just to clarify!<br /><br />Mr E had some hot and spicy Singapore noodles, but they had coriander in them so I was staying well clear. Coriander and I have a very bad relationship! Mini-M was having spaghetti hoops (nutritional purists cover your ears, but at the moment there are so few things she will actually eat, we're just going with it). So I was left with a blank canvas to make dinner for one. Preferably in 5 mins, since everyone else's food was ready. And with a very ripe avocado and a large flat mushroom that was definitely passing its prime.<br /><br />So I had low expectations on the taste front and was very happily surprised - hence the reason my 'sling it all together and eat it because you know it's good for you' tea has ended up being blogged.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XEvz-uLWDuA/T0oqYx--tYI/AAAAAAAACgQ/xJcNq-Pv6lU/s1600/100_1254.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XEvz-uLWDuA/T0oqYx--tYI/AAAAAAAACgQ/xJcNq-Pv6lU/s400/100_1254.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>The very ripe avocado turned into almost a sauce, and the mushrooms were, well, mushroomy which was enhanced by the sesame oil and lemon.<br /><br /><b>Mushroom and Avocado Noodles</b> (serves 1)<br /><br /><ul><li>1 nest of medium egg noodles</li><li>1 small very ripe avocado</li><li>1 large flat mushroom</li><li>1/2 a lemon</li><li>1 tbsp rapeseed oil</li><li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil</li><li>2 tsp hot sauce</li></ul><br />Heat the oils in a small frying pan, and whilst they are coming up to temperature, peel and chop the mushroom into chunks.<br />Fry until cooked, then take off the heat and stir in the hot sauce.<br />Put the noodles on to boil in salted water and cook for 3 mins (or whatever is recommended on the packet), then drain.<br />Meanwhile cut the avocado into chunks and mash roughly with the lemon juice and a pinch of salt.<br />Once the noodles are ready, mix everything together and enjoy!<br /><br />
