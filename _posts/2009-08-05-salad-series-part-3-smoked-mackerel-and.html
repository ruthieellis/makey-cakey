So life got a bit busy again. And that's meant I've not had a lot of time for posting recipes or pics. I have done quite a lot of baking and cooking, and even remembered for take some photos, so now that things are marginally less manic, there might be some more posts going up soon. But I thought I should finish what I'd started and go for the third and final Salad Series installment - Smoked Mackerel and apple. So here it is! Since I made it a weeeeeeee while ago, I can't exactly remember what went into it, so it's not the most specific recipe in the work - sorry! (Although to be honest the chances of anyone a) reading or b) being inspired to make anything from the site are pretty slim, so I'm thinking it's not something I need to worry about too much...)<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Smoked Mackerel and Apple Salad</div><div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SnnXJOqfBoI/AAAAAAAAAMU/NEjptRhm1z4/s1600-h/100_2965.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SnnXJOqfBoI/AAAAAAAAAMU/NEjptRhm1z4/s320/100_2965.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5366556984543741570" border="0" /></a>Here's what I think I put in....<br /><ul><li>1 vacuum pack of smoked mackerel, flaked.</li><li>3 red apples cored and chopped but with the skins left on</li><li>2 spring onions finely sliced</li><li>1tbsp fresh parsley, chopped.</li></ul><br />For the dressing -<br /><ul><li>1x 284 ml carton of soured cream</li><li>1 tbsp dried dill</li><li>1 lemon juiced</li><li>Salt &amp; Pepper</li></ul><br />Mix it all together and enjoy :0) It was really yummy, and went into pitta breads for lunch the next day which was also great.<br /><br /></div>
