<div style="text-align: left;">Whilst keeping up to date with my blog reading list last night, I read a lovely post by <a href="http://www.luvinthemommyhood.com/2011/03/little-about-me-little-about-you.html">luvinthemommyhood</a> with a snapshot of what she was thinking/dreaming/making/cooking/yearning yesterday. And as she suggested, I thought I'd give it a go and share a snapshot of  a slightly rainy Thursday morning in Edinburgh. So today I am sharing my 28 pieces of slightly self-indulgent trivia! But first, my current favourite photo, taken on Sunday evening at Cockenzie harbour.</div><div><br /><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TXMSCYWrMr0/TZRLOpcNvJI/AAAAAAAAAmw/0Hf0Rj1I93Q/s400/100_6875.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5590175752488074386" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Making:</span> woven scrap fabric bowls on a hula-hoop "loom"</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Cooking:</span> something to use up the jerusalem artichokes left over from last week's veg box, although I've not yet found recipe inspiration</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Drinking:</span> apple squash</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Reading:</span> this month's 'Lonely Planet' magazine</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Wanting:</span> another hour or so of sleep, as usual!</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Looking:</span> at the carnage Mini-M and I have created in the living room, and it's only 10am</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Playing:</span> Kate Rusby on my iTunes</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Wasting:</span> time and energy getting angry at things I can't change</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Sewing:</span> a cross-stitch that I started about 5 years ago</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Wishing:</span> there were more hours in the day</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Enjoying:</span> watching Mini-M learn new things every day</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Waiting:</span> for my bargain eBay Hippy Chick baby seat to arrive in the post so I can carry Mini-M around the house without wrecking my back any more</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Liking:</span> that my second post got accepted for <a href="http://foodgawker.com/post/archive/makeycakey/">Foodgawker</a> yesterday, and I've had almost two hundred site visits since then :o)</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Wondering:</span> if the childcare arrangements will work out when I go back to work in a week and a half...</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Loving:</span> the lighter evenings now that the clocks have changed</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Hoping:</span> that Mini-M decides to behave on the epic bus trek to Balerno we have to do later today, and doesn't scream every time the bus stops.</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#CC33CC;">Marvelling:</span> that I have an almost-9-month-old baby.
