<div style="text-align: left;">I'm going for the quadruple - one more blog post tonight before I toddle off to bed.</div><div>
<br /></div><div>Last week I was looking for a recipe to use some lovely <a href="http://www.eastcoastorganics.co.uk/">East Coast veg box</a> carrots in a new and exciting way. Coleslaw, carrot soup, and carrot cake weren't really cutting it. I then remembered the recipe on the facing page to the cheese flapjacks I made a while back - it was for a decidedly weird sounding version of Scotch eggs. Weird because they featured no meat, carrots, and oats.</div><div>
<br /></div><div>I have to confess that I am attracted to weird sounding recipes. Ones that sound so unappealing make me conclude they must have hidden charms otherwise they'd have never made it into cookbooks. This one definitely delivers!</div><div>
<br /></div><div>In case you were wondering, no... I didn't strictly follow the recipe but the modifications were for once not too major!</div><div>

<br /></span></div><div><b>Vegetarian Scotch Eggs</b> (Makes 4)</div><div>Based on a recipe from "Mornflake Oat Cuisine" </div><div><ul><li>1tbsp olive oil</li><li>1 onion, chopped</li><li>50g ground hazelnuts</li><li>1 slice of half rye/half wheat bread (approx 50g)</li><li>50g rolled oats</li><li>2 medium carrots finely grated</li><li>1 tbsp sesame seeds</li><li>1 tbsp sweet chilli sauce</li><li>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</li><li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li><li>4 hard boiled eggs</li></ul></div><div>Preheat the oven to 190C.</div><div>Shell the hard boiled eggs, keeping them whole.</div><div>Heat the oil and fry the onion until soft.</div><div>Put the grated carrots, torn up bread, sesame seeds, oats, hazelnuts and cooked onion into a food processor, and blitz until a uniform crumbly mixture forms.</div><div>Add the egg, ketchup and chilli sauce and blitz again to form a paste.</div><div>Gently mould a quarter of the mixture around each egg.</div><div>Place on an oiled baking sheet, and bake for 20-25mins until golden.</div><div>
<br /></div><div>We at these hot for tea with a bowl of soup. They were lovely - very different from the sausagey variety, but just as tasty, if not more so! I'm interested to see how they taste cold - I'll just have to make some more at some point, and let the cool down first!</div><div>
