Well, here is what greeted me when I looked in my lunch bag today...<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/ShrhQ_7jbHI/AAAAAAAAAKg/816PF2Jvebk/s1600-h/DSC00315.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5339827990356520050" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/ShrhQ_7jbHI/AAAAAAAAAKg/816PF2Jvebk/s320/DSC00315.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 320px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 240px;" /></a>It is indeed BananaMan... of a sort! And it was drawn using a Sharpie by my husband this morning whilst I was being very slow and grumpy about getting up and going to work (sadly an almost daily occurrence). I'm not even going to start to contemplate what goes through his head sometimes - and it's probably for the best! But it definitely made me smile which can only be good. It sat on my disk and grinned at me all day and I couldn't quite eat it - so it'll still be there to make me smile tomorrow :o) Here's a sideways shot too...<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/Shri0jjEDSI/AAAAAAAAAKo/h0LoZeA7khg/s1600-h/DSC00314.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5339829700724526370" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/Shri0jjEDSI/AAAAAAAAAKo/h0LoZeA7khg/s320/DSC00314.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 240px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" /></a>Am quite taken by Banana art... it might catch on!
