So, I'm getting off to a bad start for this month's Daring Bakers challenge - I've just realised this was supposed to be posted yesterday - oops! Better late than never I guess.<br />Instead of something baked, this month the challenge was to make <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">cannoli</span>. Without going into too much detail, since it's 23:23 by my computer clock and that means imminently time for bed, they are a type of Sicilian fried desert pastry, filled with a creamy filling - traditionally made with ricotta cheese and dried fruits and nuts. They are fried on <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">cannoli</span> tubes to keep them hollow, and the filling can then be piped in when they are cool.<br />This challenge was a joint attempt - the lovely Lisa (my little sis) came round and helped me create kitchen carnage. Since we didn't have any <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">cannoli</span> forms, or a handy wooden broom handle to butcher as many people seem to have used, we opted for dried pasta <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">canneloni</span> shells to form our <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">cannoli</span> round. I'd say this was a success, but not foolproof - unfortunately the shape of some of the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">canneloni</span> tubes changed during the deep frying, making the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">cannoli</span> an absolute nightmare to remove. But anyway, enough of the chat - here are the only two half acceptable pictures I managed to take!<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SxGyL0GtrlI/AAAAAAAAAO0/yQMsu9ABosU/s1600/DSC00488.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2009-11-28-image-0000.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5409300543483784786" border="0" /></a>The fried shells dipped in chocolate and almost ready for filling... we filled them with <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">mascarpone</span> cheese, sweetened with icing sugar and chopped fresh mango.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SxGyMEuFP3I/AAAAAAAAAO8/XHv0-U41N8w/s1600/DSC00491.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2009-11-28-image-0001.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5409300547943874418" border="0" /></a>And there you have it! <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">Cannoli</span>. How did they taste - well they were nice, but on balance we both agreed that they maybe weren't quite worth the effort, but definitely a fun experiment!
