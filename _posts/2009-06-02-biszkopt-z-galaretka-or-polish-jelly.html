A few years ago I spent the summer working in an office in Warsaw, and during that time, every arrival, departure or celebratory occasion in the office was celebrated with cake. And the cake of choice seemed to be jelly cake (or Biszkopt z Galaretka I believe...). It came in a wide variety of flavours and styles - with and without cream, and using raspberries, strawberries, peaches and blueberries - endless possibilities!<br /><br />Well at my current workplace, cake also plays an important part in the weekly schedule, with everyone taking their turn to provide 'Monday Cakes'. And 1st June was my turn. In honour of the gorgeous summery weather (and the fact that strawberries were on special offer at ASDA) I decided to recreate the jelly cake, of the strawberry no-cream variety.<br /><br />I made a fatless whisked sponge for the base and after a LOT of trauma and worry that a) the jelly would just soak right in, or b) accidentally set in the jug whilst I was leaving it to thicken to prevent a) from happening... it all kind of worked out right. It seemed to be enjoyed by all, and definitely ticked the boxes of light and summery, so I'm sure there will be future experimentation of flavours on the cards...<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SiWlNPstNOI/AAAAAAAAAKw/YfVO6g1Dz78/s1600-h/100_2738.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SiWlNPstNOI/AAAAAAAAAKw/YfVO6g1Dz78/s400/100_2738.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5342858179915887842" border="0" /></a>
