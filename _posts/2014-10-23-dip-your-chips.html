This is a quick-turnaround post of what we had for our dinner tonight, before I forget the recipe! (Excuse the poorly lit phone photo - it's October in Scotland and therefore we're into the season of living in the semi-dark until about April - joyful.)<br /><br />For dinner tonight we had oven chips - with tuna and tomato dip, rocket salad and baba ghanoush. I'm putting it into the "slightly healthier than regular junk food" category - I was really delicious.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uGLomPbd_rc/VElgMmUnYtI/AAAAAAAAIIM/V_HYQHmMgrY/s1600/2014-10-23%2B17.43.54.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uGLomPbd_rc/VElgMmUnYtI/AAAAAAAAIIM/V_HYQHmMgrY/s1600/2014-10-23%2B17.43.54.jpg" height="400" width="300" /></a></div><br />Don't worry, I'm not join to post a recipe for oven chips, but rather for the high-speed super cheat baba ghanoush, which was really the star of the meal and only took 10 minutes to make.<br /><br /><b>High-Speed Super Cheat Baba Ghanoush</b> (makes a generous dollop for 3!)<br /><br /><ul><li>1 medium aubergine</li><li>2 tbsp lemon infused oil (I used <a href="http://www.supernature.uk.com/index.php/infused-rapeseed-oil-250ml/rapeseed-oil-lemon">Supernature cold pressed rapeseed</a> - it's delicious and made only 8 miles from Edinburgh)</li><li>pinch dried garlic granules</li><li>pinch salt</li><li>1 tbsp tahini (or if you're pushing cheating to the max like me, 1 tbps nut butter - I had no tahini left so used almond butter)</li></ul><br />Trim the top off the aubergine and prick all over with a fork. Put on a microwaveable plate and cover with clingfilm. Mircrowave for 2 minutes then take out, uncover, turn over, re-cover and cook for 2 more minutes. It should feel soft all over. If not, cook in 30 minute increments until it does.<br />Cut in half and scrape all of the flesh out into a mixing bowl.<br />Add all of the other ingredients and blitz until blended.<br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Mini-M wasn't entirely convinced, although she did try it, but Mr E and I definitely were. I think she possibly heard the word "aubergine" being mentioned before she tasted it.<br /><br />Does it taste authentic - undoubtedly not. Does it retain some of the authentic character - definitely yes! And it is ready in 10 minutes. The taste would be a lot more authentic if you used tahini rather than almond butter and it would definitely down just as successfully. If you wanted a bit more punch you could use a clove of fresh garlic crushed instead of the granules too.<br /><br />From a health comparison, I've compared it with a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise, as a likely alternative chip-dip: it comes in at around 160kcal per serving, compared to 270kcal for mayonnaise but still tastes fantastically creamy with loads of flavour. It also packs in a good dose of fibre into the bargain. And it's delicious spread on chicken sandwiches too (which is what I did with it last time I made it, but forgot to take any photos).
