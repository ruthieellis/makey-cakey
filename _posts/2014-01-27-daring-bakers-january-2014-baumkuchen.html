A very quick post - it's getting late, another early weekday morning beckons tomorrow, and I've realised at the last minute yet again that it's Daring Bakers challenge posting day today. Considering I did actually make the challenge this time, I thought I really should share!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JUsjV3CREVM/Uubgyyp2RjI/AAAAAAAAHmo/NwWRR3ZkhqE/s1600/DSC02909.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JUsjV3CREVM/Uubgyyp2RjI/AAAAAAAAHmo/NwWRR3ZkhqE/s1600/DSC02909.JPG" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>Blog Checking Lines</b>:<br />The January 2014 Daring Bakers' challenge was hosted by <a href="http://kokenindebrouwerij.blogspot.co.uk/">Francijn of "Koken in de Brouweij"</a>. She challenged us all to bake layered cakes in the tradition of Baumkuchen (tree cake) and Schichttorte (layered cake).<br /><br />You can find an informative background and step-by-step recipe <a href="http://thedaringkitchen.com/recipe/tree-cake-baumkuchen">here on the Daring Kitchen website</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YaCuSMXIc8g/UubguWxqojI/AAAAAAAAHmg/wsujwKk_uHA/s1600/DSC02911.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YaCuSMXIc8g/UubguWxqojI/AAAAAAAAHmg/wsujwKk_uHA/s1600/DSC02911.JPG" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><br />I halved the recipe, and instead of using apricot jam to glaze the cake before pouring on the chocolate coating, I used apple and lavender jelly. I have to confess that whilst baking, I was slightly distracted and mixed up the caster and icing sugar - using the wrong one at the wrong point in the recipe, but it didn't seem too critical - phew!<br /><br />I baked it in a 1lb loaf tin, and got about 7 layers before I ran out of space, although I had enough mixture left for another 2 or 3 layers. I also tried to go for an ombre effect, adding a couple more drops of pink food colouring each time, although it only became apparent in the latter few layers. A rainbow version would be amazing!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HKTvOXhJg48/Uubg455CFLI/AAAAAAAAHmw/wENReybRjaY/s1600/DSC02912.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HKTvOXhJg48/Uubg455CFLI/AAAAAAAAHmw/wENReybRjaY/s1600/DSC02912.JPG" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">In order to make it dairy free I just switched the butter for non-dairy sunflower margarine, and used non-dairy chocolate to cover it. I'm blaming that for the horrendous bloom it got - since it isn't proper chocolate (I didn't want to use really dark stuff because Mini-M was excited by the layers and wanted to try it, but doesn't really like chocolate), it doesn't melt or temper quite like you'd imagine! Still has a chocolate-y taste though :-)</div>
