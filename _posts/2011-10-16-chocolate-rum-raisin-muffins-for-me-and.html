The other night I decided I was going to make Mini-M some muffins, as a variation on the pancake theme. I figured they might be a good foil for hiding some "Cheezly" (fake dairy free soya cheese - hiding it definitely helps its edibility...) and veggies.<br /><br />But whilst flicking through books looking for a savoury muffin recipe, I found one for chocolate rum and raisin muffins, which sounded quite a lot more fun to make!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ncAnXb67Hg8/Tpsu9SmOf1I/AAAAAAAABfI/8y2OekE4dRU/s1600/101_0537.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-16-image-0000.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />So I made them both. I made up the "Cheezly" recipe as I went along, and it worked out just fine, and I modified the Chocolate Rum &amp; Raisin one from the Australian Womens Weekly 'Muffins' mini book to make it Dairy Free. I also modified it to save on the washing up - you end up mixing it all in one big pan.<br /><br />It is completely undetectable, and really hard to believe that these are dairy free. In fact, I took them in to work, and I don't think anyone there suspected...<br /><br />So here are my recipes.<br /><br />First up the exciting chocolate ones :o)<br /><br /><b>Chocolate Rum &amp; Raisin Muffins</b><br /><br /><ul><li>Makes 12 large (or in my case 6 large and 12 small)</li><li>170g raisins</li><li>60ml dark rum</li><li>375g self raising flour</li><li>50g cocoa powder</li><li>200g soft brown sugar</li><li>150g dark (dairy free) chocolate coarsely chopped</li><li>125g margarine (dairy free)</li><li>125ml Oatly oat cream (if you can't find it, just use another 125ml soya yoghurt)</li><li>125ml plain soya yoghurt</li><li>2 eggs</li></ul><br />Preheat the oven to 180C (170C fan) and line your muffin tin(s) with paper cases.<br />Put the raisins and rum in a large saucepan, bring to a gentle simmer and allow to cook over a really low heat for about 5 mins, then take the heat off, add the margarine and let them steep for another 5 - the residual heat will melt the margarine for you.<br />Once your raisins have cooled a bit, add the sugar, chocolate, flour, and cocoa powder. Resist the temptation to mix it just yet!<br />Next pour in the oat cream and soya yoghurt, and crack your eggs on top of it all.<br />Give the eggs a quick swirl with a fork to break up the yolks, then get stuck in with your wooden spoon and mix it really well - the last thing you want to find when you bite into a muffin is a big lump of unmixed flour! If you think your flour is prone to being lumpy, then by all means sieve it in, but I went unsieved and had no problems.<br />Spoon the mixture into the prepared tins, and bake for about 20 mins until they are crackly on the top, and springy to the touch.<br />Cool on a wire rack, then enjoy!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sdpr8VlCj4Q/Tpsu0Qp6pvI/AAAAAAAABe4/S1OmGH8d-Nc/s1600/101_0535.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-16-image-0001.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />If you're not having to be dairy free, then you can easily substitute butter for margarine, be a lot less fussy about your chocolate choice (white chocolate chips would be fantastic in this too I think!), and use 250ml of buttermilk instead of the oat cream / soya yoghurt combo.<br /><br />Next up - Mini-M's Cheezly muffins. For those of you uninitiated in these matters, Cheezly is a soya based cheese substitute. It does kind of melt, it is kind of like cheese, just not quite. On the plus side, Mini-M has never actually had real cheese to compare it to, but as she is going through a fussy phase, it is still treated with skepticism.<br /><br />Pancakes have got a very firm thumbs up from her - regardless of what I add into them, she seems happy to wolf them down. Cheezly and ham pancakes have already been consumed with abandon (OK that is a slight exaggeration - abandon is really only reserved for pancakes that have raisins in, but they were eaten happily without being flung around the living room which is, you know, quite nice.). But I am a bit fed up of making pancakes, so I decide to give mini muffins a shot.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zt3uU_p_ZbI/Tpsuw3xo9QI/AAAAAAAABew/UiUUBtN6pgU/s1600/101_0534.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-16-image-0002.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Cheezly, Carrot and Apple Muffins</b><br />(Makes 36 tiny muffins, 12 small or 6 large)<br /><br /><ul><li>150g self raising flour</li><li>50g plain flour</li><li>1 egg</li><li>60ml sunflower oil</li><li>150ml plain soya yoghurt</li><li>50ml soya milk</li><li>25g finely grated Cheezly</li><li>25g finely grated carrot and apple (I used 1 tiny apple, and 1/3 of a regular carrot)</li><li>1 pinch bicarbonate of soda</li></ul><br />Preheat the oven to 180C (170C fan) and line your tins with paper cases.<br />Sieve the flours and bicarbonate of soda into a mixing bowl (or if you're lazy like me, don't sieve, live life on the edge and risk the lumpy floury consequences - happily avoided this time!).<br />Measure the oil, yoghurt and soya milk into a jug.<br />Add the egg and beat it all together lightly.<br />Then add the Cheezly, carrot and apple and give it another quick mix.<br />Add the wet ingredients to the dry ones and mix well - use some extra elbow grease if you've not sieved the flour.<br />Spoon into the prepared tins and bake until golden and springy. If you're making tiny ones, this will be about 10 mins - large ones about 20 - small ones somewhere in between.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gCDx8rsjAT8/TpsvFv_KqPI/AAAAAAAABfY/kVoPSzKBQfI/s1600/101_0539.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-10-16-image-0003.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Mini-M's verdict seems to be that the aren't quite as tasty as pancakes. Thankfully still edible, but definitely more naturally missile shaped when she gets bored of eating....<br /><br /><br /><br />
