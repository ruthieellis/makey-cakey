We've started a new tradition - although just a small scale, Saturday teatime, chez Makey-Cakey tradition.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly it involves cake. Sponge pudding to be precise.<br /><br />We've decided that Saturday tea time is sponge pudding time, and we get to take it in turns to choose what additional flavourings go into it.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Xm9OTip2_y8/UYwbg04RBTI/AAAAAAAAF0Y/B-aWuKSiGz8/s1600/2013-04-13+18.04.11.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Xm9OTip2_y8/UYwbg04RBTI/AAAAAAAAF0Y/B-aWuKSiGz8/s400/2013-04-13+18.04.11.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Microwave sponge pudding with squirty cream - I'm feeling an 80s vibe...</td></tr></tbody></table>It's a multi-purpose sort of tradition - it means that requests for pudding and cake from Mini-M can be diverted to Saturday tea time, and yoghurt and fruit can prevail throughout the rest of the week. I like the idea of there being a recipe that Mini-M knows how to make back to front, inside out, no recipe books required. And it adds and element of both making choices and taking turns.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yIFY4s_lrz0/UYwbw_MyxEI/AAAAAAAAF0w/flKrd7nmLHQ/s1600/2013-04-27+17.26.03.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yIFY4s_lrz0/UYwbw_MyxEI/AAAAAAAAF0w/flKrd7nmLHQ/s400/2013-04-27+17.26.03.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Egg cracking - not sure who's helping who here! (Save that I'm obviously not helping at all, and taking photos instead!)</td></tr></tbody></table>I wanted a base recipe to use that was easy and preferably oven free, so after a bit of research, decided to put my trust in the Microwave Technologies Association 'Essential Steamed Pudding'. I figured that f anyone knew anything about a successful microwave sponge, it would be them!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-w7yfB2eQEeQ/UYwbyQYy69I/AAAAAAAAF04/xrQq4ESzCIY/s1600/2013-04-27+17.27.28.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-w7yfB2eQEeQ/UYwbyQYy69I/AAAAAAAAF04/xrQq4ESzCIY/s400/2013-04-27+17.27.28.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Super high speed mixing - most remained in the bowl</td></tr></tbody></table>As usual I de-dairied it, and we've been halving it which has still made plenty for Saturday pud with leftovers for Sunday. <a href="http://www.microwaveassociation.org.uk/recipes/recipe.php?id=74">You can find the original recipe here</a>.<br /><br /><b>Special Saturday Steamed Sponge</b> (Serves 4)<br /><br /><ul><li>65g dairy free margarine</li><li>75g caster sugar</li><li>1 egg</li><li>100g SR flour</li><li>30ml non-dairy milk</li><li>Added flavours of your choice!</li></ul><br />Measure the butter and sugar into a microwave proof bowl.<br />Cream together until well mixed, then beat in the egg.<br />Add the flour - beating extra hard if you can't be bothered to sieve!<br />Stir in your chosen flavours and level the top of the mix in the bowl. Give the sides a wee wipe with a cloth if you're feeling keen.<br />Cover with clingfilm, poke a couple of holes in it, and microwave - 8 mins at 80% of our category E microwave did the trick. I'd go with dropping the power a little below 100%, and going for 4 mins straight off, checking and then zapping it for an additional minute at a time until it is firm to the touch.<br /><br />Enjoy! (We seem to be favouring it served with milk - if only to cool it down to a safe eating temperature faster - after the mixing and anticipation, sometimes waiting for cooling down is a bit too much for Mini-M).<br /><br />We've put our newfangled tradition into practice for a month now, and the taking turns to choose flavours has been a little biased... Mini-M has had 3 choices, and Mr E 1 - perhaps this Saturday will be my day!<br /><br />First up we went with chopped up tinned apricots (the picture at the top of the post) - Mini-M got stuck into the chopping. They're soft enough to yield easily to a butter knife, so she could be safely let loose without too much worry.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NYQUCUUhK_o/UYwbkZCIwjI/AAAAAAAAF0g/V_7sAqFtgfE/s1600/2013-04-13+17.47.57.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NYQUCUUhK_o/UYwbkZCIwjI/AAAAAAAAF0g/V_7sAqFtgfE/s400/2013-04-13+17.47.57.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">No small fingers were harmed in the making of this pudding</td></tr></tbody></table>Next we had raspberry flavour which Mr E and Mini-M made in Granny S' kitchen.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SoK_tpLOWeA/UYwbm02mGFI/AAAAAAAAF0o/44GFwn_Xqps/s1600/2013-04-20+17.39.27.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SoK_tpLOWeA/UYwbm02mGFI/AAAAAAAAF0o/44GFwn_Xqps/s400/2013-04-20+17.39.27.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Raspberries and bad lighting</td></tr></tbody></table>Then it all went slightly odd, when Mini-M decided she wanted to put cereal in - so we did - Rice Crispies and Cheerios - which go slightly weird and chewy when microwaved. Take it on good advice that whilst not unpleasant, it's not really an experiment worth trying!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mcE3iVP8H_s/UYwb8Cj5tTI/AAAAAAAAF1I/JtDZ9OeBfXQ/s1600/2013-04-27+17.48.31.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mcE3iVP8H_s/UYwb8Cj5tTI/AAAAAAAAF1I/JtDZ9OeBfXQ/s400/2013-04-27+17.48.31.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">You can't see the cereal, but it's in there, being weird and chewy</td></tr></tbody></table>And last week, Mr E chose syrup and sultana, which was absolutely amazing after spending the afternoon doing an almost-20-mile cycle ride, having not been on a bike in 15 years.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wElafjS95l4/UYwb9b-JRBI/AAAAAAAAF1Q/cDpUzXFTx6U/s1600/2013-05-04+21.06.24.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wElafjS95l4/UYwb9b-JRBI/AAAAAAAAF1Q/cDpUzXFTx6U/s400/2013-05-04+21.06.24.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Pudding with added travelling rug tassels - and laptop - a dead giveaway that by this point I was slumped on the sofa after my cycling exertions!</td></tr></tbody></table>
