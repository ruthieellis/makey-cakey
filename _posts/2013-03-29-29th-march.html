<p>Oops! I took so many photos yesterday they ended up getting a whole blog post to themselves - and I forgot to post any here... So here's yesterday's picture today. <br>Admittedly this photo looks like we keep Mini-M caged (!) and is also out of focus. But the point is all of the socks in her washing bin. Whilst 'napping' she got up silently, opened her wardrobe, took out the socks and pants boxes, sorted the socks and put all the ones she didn't like into the washing bin. Then climbed back into bed and went to sleep. Clearly stripes were out of favour yesterday!<br></p><div class='separator' style='clear: both; text-align: center;'> <a href='http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ESOibXDX5ho/UVa7tnnANiI/AAAAAAAAFgo/qyjOduqe-L8/s1600/20130329_143816.jpg' imageanchor='1' style='margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;'> <img border='0' src='http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ESOibXDX5ho/UVa7tnnANiI/AAAAAAAAFgo/qyjOduqe-L8/s640/20130329_143816.jpg' /> </a> </div>
