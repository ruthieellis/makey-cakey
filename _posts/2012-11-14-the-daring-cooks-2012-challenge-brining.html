It's Daring Cooks time again!<br /><br /><a href="http://audaxartifex.blogspot.co.uk/">Audax of Audax Artifex</a> was our <a href="http://thedaringkitchen.com/recipe/brining-and-roasting">November 2012 Daring Cooks'</a> host. Audax has brought us into the world of brining and roasting, where we brined meat and vegetables and roasted them afterwards for a delicious meal!<br /><br />So... brining wasn't something I'd ever done before. It's not something I'm really aware of many folk doing regularly in Scotland. And I have to say, that having done it once, I'll possibly not be rushing to do it again. It wasn't difficult, nor really time consuming, but I have to confess that I just didn't see or taste any notable difference in the meat.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sS7_8R7-Ap8/UKQM8D2CDcI/AAAAAAAAEKo/ztTy3qrbM6Y/s1600/IMGP5533.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-11-14-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Both brined and roasted!</td></tr></tbody></table>I'm sure that is heresy to say that, and am feeling like I may unleash a torrent of objection (well, as much of a torrent as is possible amongst a handful of comments!). Perhaps I did it wrongly!<br /><br />I brined a small chicken for 3 hrs in a brine solution to which I added garlic, ginger and some fruity cordial. After cooking I gave Mr E a bit and asked him hopefully what it tasted of, and he said... "Um, chicken?" "Anything else?" I asked hopefully "Not really - why what did you put int" he said. And after tasting it I agreed. It just tasted of roast chicken - a flavour I could have achieved without sacrificing a knob of ginger, 2 garlic cloves, salt and cordial (I'm not grudging the water though ;o)).<br /><br />But it was still a good recipe to have tried - a new technique attempted if not mastered!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X2i-mEh8Eog/UKQNDqioA_I/AAAAAAAAEKw/6jpYjm_Gfis/s1600/IMGP5537.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-11-14-image-0001.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">We ate it with satueed potatoes and stir fried Pak Choi with chilli sauce</td></tr></tbody></table>And we did still have a delicious chicken dinner &nbsp;- thanks Audax and the Daring Cooks for broadening my culinary horizons yet again.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />
