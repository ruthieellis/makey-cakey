<br />A cross section of the biggest red cabbage ever - I took this photo after I'd removed, washed and chopped at least half of the leaves. It was about half a metre high! And it made a very tasty sausage and cabbage casserole for some hungry and wet hillwalkers returning from a little jaunt along the West Highland Way.<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-08-04-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-08-04-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><div><br /></div>
