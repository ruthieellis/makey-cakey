There area officially not enough hours in the day.<br />I'd personally like about 28 each day I think - if anyone could sort that out it would be much appreciated!<br />Until then, shortcuts are required: kitchen time is finite, and since I use up a fair amount of it baking birthday cakes for Free Cakes For Kids, what's left has to be quick and easy.<br /><br />Today's lunch creation is definitely in the category I'm christening "Not Baking but Faking". Really tasty though, so I'm sharing it here.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yaBGUWfUuoI/VtyqZiUkoZI/AAAAAAAAIpI/KiFlLYu_XGg/s1600/2016-03-06%2B13.03.01.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yaBGUWfUuoI/VtyqZiUkoZI/AAAAAAAAIpI/KiFlLYu_XGg/s400/2016-03-06%2B13.03.01.jpg" width="222" /></a></div><br /><b>Giant Veggie Sausage Roll</b> (serves 4)<br /><ul><li>1 sheet ready rolled puff pastry</li><li>1 pouch cauliflower rice (I used <a href="https://www.caulirice.com/en/home/">Cauli Rice</a> Indian Pilau style)</li><li>1 single serve instant grain pot (I used <a href="http://www.artisangrains.co.uk/">Artisan Grains</a> mint tabouleh pot)</li><li>1 small snack-size humous pot</li><li>1 egg, beaten</li></ul>Take the pastry out of the fridge about 30 mins before you want to use it.<br />Preheat the oven to 180C.<br />Make the grain pot according to the pack instructions.<br />Mix together the rehydrated grains, cauli-rice and humous together.<br />Unroll the pastry.<br />Spread the filling in a line down one half long-ways, leaving a centimetre gap all around the edge for sealing.<br />Brush around the edge very lightly with beaten egg, then fold over the other half.<br />Seal by pressing down with a fork.<br />Brush all over with the rest of the beaten egg.<br />Pierce a few fork holes in the top to allow steam to escape.<br />Slide onto a baking sheet and bake for around 30-40m until golden brown and puffed up.<br />Cool very slightly before slicing and serving.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YDIEV-aKpAk/VtyrlyDZxoI/AAAAAAAAIpY/6Fk5brYocfY/s1600/2016-03-06%2B13.09.08.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="222" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YDIEV-aKpAk/VtyrlyDZxoI/AAAAAAAAIpY/6Fk5brYocfY/s400/2016-03-06%2B13.09.08.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />We enjoyed it with a salad. The filling stayed nice and firm - making it a good veggie sausage roll contender, just with a lot more flavour.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>
