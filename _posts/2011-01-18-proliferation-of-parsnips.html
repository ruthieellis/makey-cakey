<div style="text-align: left;">Parsnips... a veg that up until recently I would have sworn I hated, mainly because I think they taste of soap. And to be honest, if you just give me some cooked parsnip on its own, I still do. But since it's the winter - not a very veg-friendly time in Scotland, and parsnips are hardy creatures, our veg box has been full of them. And then I found a pack drastically reduced in the supermarket, and I'm a sucker for a bargain, which is how I came to find myself in the situation described by the title - parsnip overload!</div><div><br /></div><div>So I did a bit of <a href="http://foodgawker.com/">foodgawker</a> surfing and felt the parsnip inspiration. Below are the results of the recent parsnip-fest on the menu in our house!</div><div><br /></div><div><u><b>Parsnip Risotto</b></u> - largely inspired by this recipe by <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-01-184c8d6096-large-image-0001.html">Lucullian delights</a>. But minus the parmesan, with some crispy Spanish ham, and balsamic syrup.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-01-18-image-0000.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5563506504390808626" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><br /></span></div><div>Here's a very rough recipe! (Serves 4)</div><div><br /></div><div>Saute <b><i>1 chopped onion</i></b>, in <b><i>1 tbsp olive oil</i></b>, with <b><i>1 large pinch of dried rosemary</i></b>, until the onion is soft. Add a little more oil, then tip in <b><i>3 small parsnips</i></b> which have been peeled and diced. Allow to soften for about 5 mins. Then add <b><i>225g of risotto rice</i></b> and stir until the rice is well coated in the oil. Add about <b><i>150ml of cider</i></b>, and gradually about <b><i>1.2litres of chicken stoc</i></b>k, in your normal risotto making fashion (some go for the gradual addition and near constant stirring, others bung it all in at the start and hope for the best. Me - I'm between the two - I add the first half of the liquids slowly with lots of stirring, then usually get impatient, and chuck the rest in at once). Meanwhile, in as small a pan as you have, simmer 3<b><i>tbsp balsamic vinegar</i></b> with <b><i>1 tbsp brown sugar</i></b> until it goes syrupy. And multitasking to the max, finely chop some <b><i>Serrano ham, or chorizo, or bacon</i></b>, or basically anything meaty and salty, and fry until crispy. Drizzle the syrup and sprinkle with crispy ham before serving. </div><div><br /></div><div>This was lovely - and didn't taste sad and disappointing at all, despite a) being made of parsnips, and b) missing the parmesan cheese and butter that usually make risotto yummy.</div><div><br /></div><div>Next up I went for a parsnip and lamb tatin, based on a recipe by<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-01-1837734d57-large-image-0002.html&amp;langpair=es|en"> Food and Cook</a>. It was also a parsnippy pleasure!</div><div><br /></div><div><b><u>Parsnip and Lamb Tatin</u></b> (serves 4)</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-01-18-image-0001.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5563506515869697746" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div>Chop <b><i>1 onion</i></b> and saute in a <b><i>tablespoon of olive oi</i></b>l with a <b><i>generous pinch of dried rosemary</i></b>. Then add a <b><i>couple of medium parsnips</i></b>, peeled and sliced, and about <b><i>250g of left over slow roasted lamb shoulder</i></b>. Cook on the hob for about 5 mins until everything softens down a bit, then roll out <b><i>1 packed of ready made puff pastry</i></b> into an approximate circle, and use to top your pan, pushing it down well around the edges (but don't forget like I did, that the pan edges are HOT!). Brush with <b><i>beaten egg</i></b>, then pop in the oven at about 180C for about 25 mins. Tip out onto a large plate or board, and cross your fingers it hasn't all stuck to the bottom!!!!! It adds and extra element of excitement to the dish. Mine did a bit, which is why it doesn't look too photogenic.</div><div><br /></div><div>And finally, so that baby Martha didn't feel left out of the parsnip love...</div><div><br /></div><div><b><u>Parsnip, apple and coconut puree</u></b> (makes about 6 baby portions)</div><div><br /></div><div>Peel and finely chop <b><i>1 apple</i></b> and <b><i>1 parsnip</i></b>. Put in a pan with a <b><i>couple of tablespoons of water</i></b>, and a <b><i>couple of tablespoons of unsweetened dessicated coconut</i></b>. Cook until the parsnip and apple are soft, then blitz with a magic wand. </div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-01-18-image-0002.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5563506511722461666" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px; " /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; ">Happy parsnipping!</span></div>
