Sara and Erica of <a href="http://baking-jds.blogspot.co.uk/">Baking JDs</a> were our March 2012 Daring Baker hostesses! Sara &amp; Erica challenged us to make Dutch Crunch bread, a delicious sandwich bread with a unique, crunch topping. Sara and Erica also challenged us to create a one of a kind sandwich with our bread.<br /><br />This has been a hectic month, and so the Daring Bakers was pushed to the bottom of my to do list, and suddenly it was today, the 27th, posting day and I hadn't even started! I didn't have time to bake 'proper' bread, with kneading and rising, but was keen to try the tiger Dutch Crunch topping, which forms a cracked pattern as it cooks, earning it the nickname tiger bread (or giraffe bread, as Sainsbury's recently rebranded theirs in the UK).<br /><br />So what was I to do... make tiger soda bread!!! And it worked - it's always a relief when crazy last minute experiments come out OK.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q_bCfnoUioE/T3IeW299K7I/AAAAAAAACpo/v3kMyURd5Cg/s1600/27032012300.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q_bCfnoUioE/T3IeW299K7I/AAAAAAAACpo/v3kMyURd5Cg/s400/27032012300.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Here's how I did it.<br /><b><br /></b><br /><b>Dairy Free Soda Bread</b> (makes 1 loaf)<br /><br /><ul><li>370g plain flour</li><li>130g wholemeal flour</li><li>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li><li>1/2 tsp salt</li><li>40g sunflower oil</li><li>300ml almond milk</li><li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li></ul><br /><b>Tiger Topping</b> (enough for 1-2 loaves)<br /><br /><ul><li>1 tbsp dried active yeast</li><li>120ml warm water</li><li>1 tbsp sugar</li><li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li><li>generous pinch of salt</li><li>120g brown rice flour</li></ul><br />Preheat the oven to 190C (fan) and grease a baking sheet.<br />In a bowl, whisk together all of the topping ingredients and leave to sit for 15 minutes whilst you make the soda bread dough.<br />Mix the lemon juice into the almond milk ad leave to sit for a minute or two.<br />In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flours, salt and bicarbonate of soda until thoroughly combined.<br />Make a well in the centre, add the oil and about 250ml of the milk.<br />Mix until it forms a sticky dough, adding more of the milk as needed. If it gets too sticky you can always add a little bit extra flour.<br />Tip out onto a floured surface and knead for a minute then form into a short fat sausage.<br />Put it on your greased baking sheet and flatten off slightly.<br />Liberally smear the top in the Tiger Topping. Very liberally, otherwise it won't crack. You'll have some left over, but not too much!<br />Bake near the top of the oven for about 30 mins until cracked and browned, and the loaf sounds hollow when you turn it over and knock on the bottom.<br />Soda bread can sometimes be a bit doughy in the middle - to help solve this problem, you can tip it upside down and give it an extra few minutes that way.<br />Cool on a rack.<br /><br />So what does it taste like...? I don't know! It's waiting to become tomorrow's breakfast, so no sandwich pictures. I'll update this tomorrow after we've tried it.<br /><br />But it certainly looks the part...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6UrBFBS74uY/T3IebIFMAxI/AAAAAAAACpw/yn121rpKPkI/s1600/27032012301.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6UrBFBS74uY/T3IebIFMAxI/AAAAAAAACpw/yn121rpKPkI/s400/27032012301.JPG" width="400" /></a></div>
