Within a month, we have all three of our family birthdays, so from mid-July to mid-August I'm generally slightly preoccupied with birthday cakes!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Gq7SW0Sf-04/UizgubFBEZI/AAAAAAAAGpA/o8MYIsIuEpM/s1600/DSC01413.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-09-08-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />This year, Mr E turned 30 and we had a party for family and friends halfway up Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, complete with kilts, party frocks, bubbles, chilli and nachos, umbrellas, rain, wellies - and of course cake.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-n8ZBZHBkjsw/UizhIZ7X_TI/AAAAAAAAGpc/WKIRllBXPK8/s1600/DSC01495.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-09-08-image-0001.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Smal people eagerly awaiting candle blowing out / cake eating!</td></tr></tbody></table>I wanted to make something that would be easy to prepare in advance. Mini-M wanted to decorate the cake. I wanted it not to look too much like a crazy toddler special, since it was going to be dessert for everyone. My original plan was to let her decorate the cake with a variety of sweets, and went on an inspiration / ingredient gathering mission to ASDA to see what dairy-free decorative delights I could come up with. They had After Eights on special offer - and the rest, as they say, is history!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8Qpgpovrzzk/UizhFe6RYzI/AAAAAAAAGpU/_ckaToR-54M/s1600/DSC01415.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-09-08-image-0002.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />(I should point out now that After Eights aren't actually dairy free - they do have butterfat in them, but that doesn't seem to be a problem for me - but obviously might be for some people. Butterfat contains minimal amounts of milk proteins - but there are still likely to be traces).<br /><br />Whilst pondering the box of After Eights (mainly along the lines of 'maybe I could just eat one...') I realised that 30 would fit on the top of the cake tin I was planning to use, so I decided to ice them as little cartoon faces, using writing icing. The ultimate prepare-ahead cake decorating solution.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9lw3Sqw1nxw/Uizge-nZXTI/AAAAAAAAGo0/Q_cqMzRLjUE/s1600/DSC01339.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-09-08-image-0003.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />For the cake itself, since I was making enough for 30, I made a 9-egg sponge, using dairy free sunflower spread instead of butter. I weighed the eggs, then used equal quantities of sugar, SR flour and margarine. I spooned half of the mixture into the cake tin in dollops, then added 1oz of cocoa powder, 1 tsp peppermint extract and a couple of tablespoons of milk into the remaining batter, mixed well, and dolloped that into the tin too, giving it a quick swirl around before baking (in a rectangular roasting tin) for around 40 mins at 180C (160C fan). It turned out a lovely moist chocolate mint marble cake.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5eNYnB32ejg/Uizg75OHOKI/AAAAAAAAGpM/ol6ZhwsSuKY/s1600/DSC01414.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-09-08-image-0004.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />I made 'butter' icing using dairy free sunflower margarine again - if you beat in enough icing sugar, it doesn't taste too margarine-y - still sweet and lovely - especially when you're about to cover it with mints :-)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tpSax6bTfFQ/UizgODm_77I/AAAAAAAAGok/U2YJPccLcQ4/s1600/2013-08-16+20.10.09.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-09-08-image-0005.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I think this next one is probably my favourite of the cake photos - I didn't realise until after I'd taken it that the face on the right has a shocked expression - maybe that's at the sight of Mr E represented in rectangular chocolate for on the left...</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0kJO9WZgPfM/UizhfocCxsI/AAAAAAAAGpw/9BjXV1erSO8/s1600/DSC01503.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-09-08-image-0006.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />I thought that my After Eight iced Mr E was fairly lifelike - but Mini-M didn't agree, and failed to recognise him out of the other 29, despite being the only on with a) glasses or b) hair!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tcVbLiRbnG0/Uizhcjzv2OI/AAAAAAAAGpk/f5lKJ-1NW5Y/s1600/DSC01504.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-09-08-image-0007.jpg" width="265" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">I'm submitting this to the <a href="http://choclogblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/we-should-cocoa-37-september-challenge.html">September We Should Cocoa blog challenge</a> - the theme is Showstopper Chocolate Cakes, and since this one is at least 50% chocolate cake, with chocolate on the top, I'm figuring it counts!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xRcxOUIde6Y/UiNJAe44MUI/AAAAAAAAKYg/UsyzCriAJM4/s1600/We_Should_Cocoa_V3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-09-08-image-0008.jpg" width="197" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>
