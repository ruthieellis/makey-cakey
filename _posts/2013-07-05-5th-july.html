Mini-M in full on model pose! Captured accidentally - she was actually concentrating on balancing. Best quote of the day at the park... "Daddy come and catch me, I'm going to be doing dangerous things" (aka going headfirst down the slide it turned out). Thankfully bare legs are fairly high friction, so not that dangerous.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-07-05-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-07-05-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />
