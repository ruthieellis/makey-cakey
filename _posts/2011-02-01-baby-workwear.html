<div style="text-align: left;">For once this is a makey rather than a cakey post. Believe it or not, I do make quite a lot of stuff - most often, my husband will probably vouch for, I make a mess. But sometimes, just sometimes, it is a creative mess! In fact I am taking part in the <a href="http://thing-a-day.com/">2011 Thing-A-Day challenge</a>. In its own words, it is "The yearly creative sprint" where participants are challenged to do something creative every day for the whole of February, and the results are posted on a communal blog. I'm going to be making kirigami hearts (cut and folded paper) which should be manageable whilst the M-ster naps. Once I've finished I'll pop all the pictures up here - maybe even in a slideshow, if I can get that technical.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyways, back to the matter in hand. Way way back in Spring last year, when Mini-M was still a Mini-bump some friends and I got together along with some fabric pens, and a multi-pack of white baby vests to create some customised clothing for the imminent arrival. Much fun was had, and because she was such a teeny baby when she arrived, they still fit! Score. Whilst I was changing her the other day, I thought I'd snap a couple of pics of the one I decorated. </div><div><br /></div><div>In case you're questioning the weird design for a baby girl a) we thought she was a boy, and b) I'm an engineer, and a couple of the patterns we did were sort of engineer-y. This one would obviously be for client meeting days....</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; color: #0000ee;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5568654399765102082" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TUfVrC7qPgI/AAAAAAAAAaA/5je8oC6TxbU/s400/100_5924.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 400px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center; width: 300px;" /></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline;"><i>Please ignore the grungy looking carpet... we will hire a vax one of these years</i>!</span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; color: #0000ee;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5568654526882173506" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TUfVyceu0kI/AAAAAAAAAaI/92dgiYlKSEg/s400/100_5934.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 300px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline;"><i>Proudly showing off the fact that she has no teeth, but ridiculously long eyelashes!</i></span></span></div>
