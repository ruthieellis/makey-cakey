I'm squeezing in a blog post this evening - possibly at the expense of writing Christmas cards - but I'm sure the world won't end if some people end up getting Hogmanay cards instead, right?<br /><br />A few weeks back I posted a fairy birthday cake, and this one was for the little fairy's big sister who requested a chocolate cake with a snow dragon in it.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cOy1l1qop1A/UNIr6jInnNI/AAAAAAAAElw/ahoRGUx7BdE/s1600/2012-12-15+00.09.20.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-12-19-image-0000.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Confession: I had (still have) no idea what a snow dragon is. The little girl in question's Mum wasn't sure either, so in the end I just went for a dragon who was having a snowball fight - since that covered both the snow and dragon bases!<br /><br />The cake itself is my favourite chocolate cake recipe - it's made using golden syrup, and it has a great flavour, a nice solid crumb, it keeps well, freezes perfectly and is fairly easy to shape and carve if you need to do any cake shaping.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U0d-fgFFqmQ/UNIruUGu-_I/AAAAAAAAElg/LP_3wy7FCH0/s1600/2012-12-15+00.08.47.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-12-19-image-0001.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />It's based on a recipe from 'Fun Cakes for Special Occasions by Ann Nicol' - a now-slightly-retro-looking celebration cake book from 1997, which now seems to be out of print. I've adapted the recipe to be dairy free, and here's my version:<br /><br /><b>Golden Syrup Chocolate Cake</b> (Makes an 8" round cake)<br /><ul><li>275g plain flour</li><li>1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li><li>1 tsp baking powder</li><li>4 generous tbsp cocoa powder</li><li>175g light muscovado sugar</li><li>100g dairy free margarine (I used Pure sunflower)</li><li>200ml chocolate flavour Oatly oat milk</li><li>3 tbsp golden syrup</li><li>2 medium eggs lightly beaten</li></ul>Grease and base line your tin and preheat the oven to 160C.<br />Sieve flour, cocoa powder, bicarb, baking powder and sugar into a large mixing bowl and stir to combined.<br />Put the margarine and chocolate oat milk in a small pan on a low heat and stir until dissolved.<br />Spoon the syrup into the warm milk and margarine and stir until combined.<br />Pour the milk mixture into the dry ingredients, then add the eggs.<br />Beat until the batter is smooth - it will be fairly runny.<br />Pour into the prepared tin.<br />Bake for approximately 50-60mins. When a skewer comes out clean it's done.<br /><br />If you don't need to make it dairy free, then feel free to use regular marge, or butter. If you're going with &nbsp;regular butter or marge, then increase the quantity to 115g and miss out one of the tsp of golden syrup to keep things in proportion.<br /><br />If you can't find chocolate oat milk, then any other non-dairy milk will do, it just won't be quite as chocolate-y! (And again, real milk will also work if you're not trying to be DF).<br /><br />To make the dragon, I used <a href="http://bakehappy.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/how-to-make-dragon-cupcake-toppers.html#.UNIoWqWBGCg">this tutorial at Bake Happy</a>. To help it dry and keep it's shape a little better, I used 60% fondant and 40% mexican modelling paste which I kneaded together before colouring.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KAwrXmXCULY/UNIr0rwRW1I/AAAAAAAAElo/MrNu3Tfu_50/s1600/2012-12-15+00.09.10.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-12-19-image-0002.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />I iced it with chocolate butter cream for which I used 250g unsalted butter, 500g icing sugar, 3 tbsp milk and 50g melted dark chocolate. That made plenty for the cake, plus enough for 6-12 cupcakes (depending on your icing philosophy... 6 if you think icing and cake should be in a 50:50 ration and piled in a towering swirl on top, 12 if you're more of a quick swipe across the top with a palette knife person).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TGF0VHT3F0Y/UNIr_9uD1KI/AAAAAAAAEl4/0RlSDwK1oF4/s1600/2012-12-15+00.09.31.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-12-19-image-0003.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />I'm submitting this to the <a href="http://www.whatkatebaked.com/2012/12/tea-time-treats-december.html">December edition of Tea Time Treats</a> - the theme for the Christmas edition is chocolate, so I think this definitely fits the bill! It's hosted alternately by <a href="http://www.lavenderandlovage.com/">Lavender and Lovage</a> and <a href="http://www.whatkatebaked.com/">What Kate Baked</a>, and this month it's What Kate Baked's turn. I'm looking forward to the roundup and seeing what everyone else has made.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-18Ie8uRwjfA/UNIsA3WWEBI/AAAAAAAAEmA/cjQFvui7HXw/s1600/Christmas+TTT.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="200" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-12-19-image-0004.png" width="200" /></a></div>
