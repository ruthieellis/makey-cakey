We've started getting an organic fruit and veg box delivered weekly from <a href="http://www.eastcoastorganics.co.uk/">East Coast Organics</a>, as we were getting sick of the rubbish choice and quality at our nearest supermarket. It has not only been extremely tasty so far, but has also forced me to get creative in the kitchen and make the veg the main event, as well as finding new ways to cook some old favourites.<br /><br />Whilst browsing the interweb, I found a recipe for <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4064/mango-broccoli-and-ginger-soup">Broccoli, Mango and Ginger soup</a> on the BBC Good Food Magazine website. It sounded so random I had to give it a shot!<br /><br />I subbed the Thai Curry paste for just a plain old chili, and the single cream for coconut cream (since I appear to be unable to follow a recipe without adultering it in some way or another!).<br /><br />That said, it was ace, tasted delicious - smooth and creamy, and I urge you to surprise your tastebuds and make it!<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TLLuvFLqgLI/AAAAAAAAAQg/9BBkGlMsxOM/s1600/DSC00187.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5526742185349382322" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TLLuvFLqgLI/AAAAAAAAAQg/9BBkGlMsxOM/s400/DSC00187.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 400px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" /></a>Broccoli, Mango and Ginger Soup<br /><ul><li>1 tbsp olive oil for frying</li><li>1 onion finely chopped</li><li>1 clove of garlic, crushed</li><li>1 teaspoon on grated fresh ginger</li><li>1 large head of broccoli, roughly chopped (including stem)</li><li>1 medium mango (not too ripe), peeled and chopped</li><li>half of 1 red chili, deseeded and chopped</li><li>900ml veg stock (I used Marigold powder)</li><li>2 generous tablespoons of coconut cream</li></ul>Heat oil in a large soup pan, add onion and garlic, chili and ginger and fry gently until softened. Add the mango and broccoli and cook on a low heat for about 5 mins. Add stock and simmer until the broccoli is tender but still bright green. Stir in the coconut cream then blend until smooth and add salt and pepper to taste. Enjoy!
