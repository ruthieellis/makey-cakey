I made this Peanut Butter Fudge as one of my '<a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/the-daring-bakers-november-challenge.html">12 Cookies of Christmas</a>' <a href="http://thedaringkitchen.com/">Daring Bakers</a>' challenge a few weeks back. Technically it's in no way a cookie, but it is delicious, seems vaguely festive, and is awesomely, fantastically, wonderfully dairy free. Obviously, if you want, just use real butter and real milk. But it works very well with non-dairy substitutes.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YiH-TExqF_E/UL52tpVz_zI/AAAAAAAAEiA/x5oEqBtoXlI/s1600/2012-11-27+20.35.21.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-12-04-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />It's essentially just a few tweaks to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/peanutbutterfudge_93630">Sophie Dahl's recipe which you can find on the BBC Food website</a>.<br /><br />I also halved the original quantities, since I wasn't giving it as a gift and didn't want to end up the size of a house before Christmas, and Mr E and I have been very restrained and made the batch last a whole week.<br /><br /><b>Dairy Free Peanut Butter Fudge</b> (Makes one 6"x4" rectangular tray)<br /><ul><li>60g dairy free sunflower margarine</li><li>200g dark muscovado sugar</li><li>50g caster sugar</li><li>60ml Oatly oat milk</li><li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li><li>50g crunchy peanut butter</li><li>75g smooth peanut butter</li><li>170g icing sugar</li></ul>Grease your chosen tin.<br />Melt the margarine in a small saucepan over a moderate heat.<br />Add the sugars, oat milk and vanilla extract and stir until dissolved, then allow to come to the boil and boil gently for 3 minutes without stirring.<br />Take off the heat, add the peanut butter and stir until well combined.<br />Sieve the icing sugar into a mixing bowl and then pour on the still-hot butter and sugar mixture.<br />Beat until smooth, then pour into the prepared tin.<br />Allow to cool on the worktop for an hour or so, then pop in the fridge to firm up completely.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LbiwZ3sFx0U/UL52ySfwcMI/AAAAAAAAEiI/e9aToJQa0rU/s1600/2012-11-27+21.51.40.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-12-04-image-0001.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />This is seriously good stuff - it would make a lovely present, and it's a lot less hassle than the traditional soft-ball-stage fudge, with sugar thermometers, glasses of water and endless beating, followed by the whole thing setting in the pan!<br /><br />(If you're making it with regular butter, I'd decrease the icing sugar down to 150g to match the proportions of the original recipe, but dairy free margarine makes everything a bit softer, so the extra helps stiffen it up a little.)
