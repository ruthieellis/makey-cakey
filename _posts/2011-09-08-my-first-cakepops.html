Cakepops.<br />In Scotland we don't have pops, we have lollies. Cakelollies doesn't quite have the same ring to it! It's probably for the best therefore, that Cakepops were an American invention.<br /><br />Now that I've shared that earth shattering thought, I should move on to the cake. I think less chat more cake should be my blogging motto, but I always seem to get distracted writing random rubbish - in fact here I am doing it again.<br /><br />Until this foray, I have baked many things, and made several cake truffle varieties, but never attempted the whole 'on a stick' thing. Several things coincided to make it happen...<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-t8GjIgVQmnE/Tmkj8BfQmPI/AAAAAAAABTk/AYs4m0qeB-4/s1600/28082011142.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-t8GjIgVQmnE/Tmkj8BfQmPI/AAAAAAAABTk/AYs4m0qeB-4/s320/28082011142.JPG" style="cursor: move;" width="319" /></a><br /><br />I found a whole bag of red chocolate melts lurking in the back of the cupboard, which I couldn't eat on grounds of dairy, and Mr E couldn't eat on grounds of food colouring - what a faddy sounding pair we are!<br /><br />I got given the lovely Cakepops book by Molly Bakes by Mummy School for my going back to work present (thank you lovely ladies!)<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: auto;"><br /></div><a href="http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/cake-pops/9780224095228"><img border="0" src="http://images.randomhouseimages.co.uk/9780224095228-large.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/">Borders Exploration Group</a> have started fundraising for their next international youth expedition to Cuba in 2012.<br /><br />Slowly the cogs turned in my brain and concluded that since I needed to make lots of something to use up the big bag of red melts, and the expedition were looking for funds, and I hadn't ventured into cakepops yet, I should obviously make vaguely Cuban themed cakepops to sell for fundraising.<br /><br />And what a lot of therapeutic fun it was too!<br /><br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vfORsgAVBHc/TmkkBHgT3tI/AAAAAAAABTo/w7PEtK23P0M/s1600/28082011143.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vfORsgAVBHc/TmkkBHgT3tI/AAAAAAAABTo/w7PEtK23P0M/s320/28082011143.JPG" style="cursor: move;" width="319" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: auto;"><br /></div>I'm sure there will be future cakepop experiments at some point, not least because I still have 30 sticks left - happy times ahead :o)
