Mr E and I had a Fringe day today whilst Mini-M was at nursery. We took in some Dylan Thomas (with horrendous attempts and Welsh accents), some bread making, and some jazz acapella, followed by a coffee and catch up with a fried at Brew Lab - where I took this photo. Cold brewed coffee, fresh peppermint tea (complete with green sand timer) and flat white were the order of the day.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-08-07-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-08-07-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />
