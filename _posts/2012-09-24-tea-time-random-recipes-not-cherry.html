This month's <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-09-24d4d816d5-large-image-0000.html">Random Recipes</a> challenge hosted by <a href="http://www.belleaukitchen.com/">Belleau Kitchen</a> has teamed up with Tea Time Treats hosted by <a href="http://www.lavenderandlovage.com/">Lavender and Lovage</a> and <a href="http://whatkatebaked.blogspot.co.uk/">What Kate Baked</a> to create a hybrid Tea Time Random Recipe challenge.<br /><br />We were allowed to randomly select any recipe that seemed 'tea-timey' to us, be it sweet or savoury. I decided to go down the sweet afternoon tea route, after ending up with '500 cookies' by Philippa Vanstone from my bookcase as my randomly chosen book.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-09-249e9cb5e7-large-image-0004.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-09-24-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />I then randomly picked a recipe, which turned out to be 'Cherry &amp; Oatmeal Cookies' from page 201 in the Wholesome Cookies section. Since I didn't have dried cherries in the cupboard I immediately headed off piste, and what with having to adapt it to being dairy free, I'm pretty sure what I ended up with was a fairly long way away from what the original recipe would have created. But please forgive them (and me) because at least they turned out pretty!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>And so to the question of what I substituted in place of the dried cherries. I'll give you 3 guesses... Raisins? No. Chocolate chips? Nope. Nuts of some sort? No, no, no. What's that you say - one more chance - OK! Candied melon? Yes!!! You're spot on.<br /><br />Best not to ask really how I somehow manage to have candied melon in my baking cupboard - hint, it's got a lot to do with working far too close to one of the Edinburgh Real Food shops, and repeatedly finding myself there during lunch break wanders...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-09-24257c5c8f-large-image-0005.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-09-24-image-0001.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />Anyway, these actually tasted really lovely. I gave the chocolate drizzled, butterfly adorned ones to a friend for their birthday, and kept some naked ones for eating at home. I think I may be a candied melon convert! On the subject of naked, Mini-M cracked us up yesterday by rolling her trouser legs up then running round exclaiming "My having naked knees!".<br /><br />I digress - back to the recipe...<br /><br /><b>Candied Melon Oatmeal Cookies</b> (makes 18-24)<br /><br /><ul><li>45g soya margarine</li><li>50g demerera sugar</li><li>1 egg</li><li>1/2 small pot soya yogurt (I used strawberry)</li><li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li><li>100g plain flour</li><li>pinch bicarbonate of soda</li><li>pinch salt</li><li>1/2 cup oatmeal</li><li>100g candied melon chunks</li></ul><br />Preheat the oven to 160C and line two baking sheets with greaseproof paper.<br />In a large bowl, beat together the soya margarine and demerera sugar.<br />Once soft and well combined, beat in the egg, vanilla and soya yogurt.<br />Stir in the flour, oatmeal, bicarb, salt and lastly melon chunks.<br />Place spoonfuls of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheets (they don't spread too much so you can put them fairly close).<br />Bake for 15 mins then remove from the oven and cool for a few minutes on the sheets before removing to a cooling tray.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-09-2429b1d662-large-image-0006.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-09-24-image-0002.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This recipe is seriously versatile - use any flavour of yoghurt you like (or plain). Chuck in 100g of pretty much anything in place of the melon chunks. Decorate however you like. It's an oatmeal cookie - it will still taste good (or that's my hypothesis anyway!).</div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-09-24939d94d4-large-image-0007.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-09-24-image-0003.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br />
