Not really a recipe, however too successful and discovery not to share!<br /><br />Junk food. We all know it's bad for us. We still all want to eat it far more often than we should.<br /><br />This started as an attempt to chuck together a very quick tea using whatever I could lay my hands on in the fridge/cupboard, however the end result was fantastic, and I shall no doubt make it again on purpose.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LUdj5MYYJNI/VDBgFXPiqXI/AAAAAAAAIGo/Pc2E4-3s44o/s1600/JunkFoodSalad.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LUdj5MYYJNI/VDBgFXPiqXI/AAAAAAAAIGo/Pc2E4-3s44o/s1600/JunkFoodSalad.jpg" height="400" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br />It provides a psychological junk food hit - chicken in breadcrumbs and pretzels, but at least simultaneously provides some veggies into the bargain.<br /><br />I'm not in any way claiming a) it is healthy b) it offsets the unhealthiness of the chicken/pretzels.<br />However, if say, for hypothetical example, you compared eating breaded chicken fillets in this salad, against eating them with chips, then this might edge ahead. Just.<br /><br />I'm sure you could treat a number of junk foods in the same way - Scampi salad anyone? Or chopped up burger?<br /><br /><b>Junk Food Salad</b> (Serves 3 as a meal)<br /><br /><ul><li>300g breaded chicken mini-fillets</li><li>4 Chinese leaves</li><li>1 orange pepper</li><li>2 tomatoes</li><li>1 tbsp crispy onion pieces</li><li>1 handful mini pretzels (mine were from a rosemary and pepper mix)</li><li>1 tbsp olive oil</li><li>1 tbsp cider vinegar</li><li>1 tsp honey</li><li>Squeeze of lemon juice</li></ul><br />Cook the chicken according to the pack instructions, and whilst it is in the oven, wash and chop up your salad veggies. You could use any veg you like - this was just what I had needing used up in the fridge.<br />Whisk together your dressing ingredients (or if you have a small child needing entertained, put them in a jar with a secure lid and give them to them to shake)<br />Once the chicken is cooked, slice it, add to the veg, throw in the pretzels and crispy onions, pour over the dressing, mix well and serve.<br />Done!<br /><br />There is something very appealing about the combination of the warm savoury chicken, sweet dressing, crunchy pretzels and cold crisp chinese leaves. Better than chips anyway!
