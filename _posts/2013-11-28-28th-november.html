<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">A video today - if technology plays ball. Better than the photo I took of my 'desk' aka laptop and tissue strewn bed, as I worked from home and sneezed and coughed my way through another day!&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Instead, Mini-M went to see Captain Flynn and the Pirate Dinosaurs this morning, and the rest of the day has had a rather pirate-y feel to it. Eye patch. Hook. Arrrgh Me Hearties!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOG_video_class" contentid="2916199199478eeb" height="266" id="BLOG_video-2916199199478eeb" width="320"></object></div><br />
