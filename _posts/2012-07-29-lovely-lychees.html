I have a feeling that lychees are the Marmite of the fruit world - you either love them or are completely freaked out by their slimy eye-ball-ish texture. With that introduction you might think I'm in the latter camp, but no, I'm very much a lychee lover!<br /><br />I remember getting them occasionally as a kid - which was really exciting, bearing in mind that this was the 80s in rural Scotland and supermarkets weren't quite as exotically stocked.<br /><br />Turns out ASDA in Leith in 2012 still isn't, however it does sell fizzy lychee flavour juice (why doesn't that surprise me!), which formed the starting point for these cupcakes.<br /><br />They smelt fabulously tropical whilst baking, but when tried one disappointingly just tasted mainly of cake, whilst taunting me with their lychee aroma. So to spite them, I decided to drown them in fresh strawberry icing - take that plain cakes!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oGJFnm-eFjI/UBGr5gqd6bI/AAAAAAAADTE/cEeJbk-PA34/s1600/100_3591.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-07-29-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div>The end result was pretty tasty - fluffy little tropical scented cupcakes with a sweet berry icing. I'm guessing you could substitute pretty much whichever fizzy juice took your fancy, so there's plenty of scope for experimenting with this recipe.<br /><br /><b>Lychee Cupcakes with Strawberry Icing</b> (makes 10-12 small cupcakes)<br /><br /><ul><li>1/4 cup margarine (I used dairy free)</li><li>1/2 cup sugar</li><li>1 egg</li><li>1 cup Self Raising flour</li><li>1/4 cup plus a splash of fizzy lychee juice</li><li>2 tbsp strawberry compote, (made by lightly stewing fresh strawberries with a little icing sugar and a splash of lemon)</li><li>Icing sugar - start with 1/2 cup and be prepare to add more</li></ul><br />Line a cupcake tin with paper cases and preheat the oven to 180C (160C fan).<br />Zap the margarine in the microwave until very very soft (almost melted but not quite) then beat it into the sugar.<br />Add the egg and beat again, then fold in the flour.<br />Lastly add the fizzy lychee juice and mix briefly until combined, then spoon into the prepared tin.<br />Bake for 15-20mins until risen and golden then cool on a wire rack.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-c-YxQ4Fx1vM/UBGryUXA_aI/AAAAAAAADS8/b6YZM2doAak/s1600/100_3590.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-07-29-image-0001.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br />Whilst the cakes are cooling, mash the compote well with a fork to break down the pieces of strawberry.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jygNNfYDeSw/UBGrpjz-LlI/AAAAAAAADS0/_Zg1jF8p35Q/s1600/100_3588.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-07-29-image-0002.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br />Sieve in 1/2 cup icing sugar and mix to a smooth paste. Add more icing sugar or compote as required until you reach your chosen icing consistency.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g4h1WDs0YGs/UBGsAF1J3KI/AAAAAAAADTQ/4xeQIkpIYIQ/s1600/100_3596.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-07-29-image-0003.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />
