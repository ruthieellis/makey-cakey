Sometimes I look back and wonder what nonsense I blog about.<br /><br />Here are some recent search terms that have brought traffic to my site...<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>"<b>panorama glasses</b>" Hmmm.... i thought that eyes were generally able to see panoramas without glasses - obviously not everyone agrees!</li><li>"<b>100 hippos</b>" Poor disappointed searcher. There are definitely not 100 hippos, or possibly any hippos at all here. (Just that now there are 3!)</li><li>"<b>chocolate fudge liquid glucose condensed milk dark chocolate</b>" Clearly someone was having a sweet craving...</li><li>"<b>disused railway tunnels</b>" Some railway enthusiast (or mugger?) possibly ended up scratching their head and wondering why they were looking at cakes</li><li>"<b>fence for garden snails</b>" I am at a loss with this one. Snails like fences, I agree, but I don't think I've ever pontificated about that fact</li><li>"<b>is bashy baileys an alliteration</b>" Yes. That is all.</li><li>"<b>make up made from icing</b>" My first reaction to this was 'gross!' but the more I think about it as I type, I realise they were probably wanting to make fake make up to put on a cake, rather than wear icing as foundation. Hopefully</li><li>"<b>marzipan hands</b>" Very sticky? Also prone to losing definition and getting a bit soft in warm weather</li><li>"<b>peel quarter and core a pear</b>" Someone needs to find instructions of Google for this? Oh dear. Surely if you can search for those words, you're pretty much already able</li><li>"<b>pygmy sheep</b>" I wish I'd written a blog post about pygmy sheep! They sound amazing.</li><li>"<b>valentine card for an engineer husband</b>" I have a husband. I am an engineer. I made a Valentines card. Almost, but not quite the same</li><li>"<b>we put up kitchen shelves</b>" Well, we did, once, but since it did not result in martial harmony, and involved several minor injuries, I did not share the triumph in blog-land!</li></ul><div>Just thought I'd share....</div><div><br /></div><div>Night!</div>
