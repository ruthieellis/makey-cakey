Yet another last minute Random Recipes post. Thankfully this time no last minute cooking was required!<br /><br />The theme for <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-12-285842acf8-large-image-0000.html">Random Recipes #35</a>, hosted and masterminded as ever by <a href="http://www.belleaukitchen.com/">Belleau Kitchen</a>, was dare to bare - of the larder rather than body variety you'll all be relieved to hear.<br /><br />However… I forgot to take any pictures of my own larder, before heading down to spend a few post-Christmas days with family, so instead, I give you all a last minute virtual tour of my Mum's larder. The chaos of mine shall remain hidden for another day.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-12-28cdd29fcf-large-image-0002.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-12-28-image-0000.jpg" width="265" /></a></div><br />Top shelf…. extra strong wholemeal bread flour, then some icing sugar sandwiched between LOTS of oatmeal (well we are Scottish after all!).<br />Next shelf down - jams, chutneys (a fair few homemade from a variety of grown up children and friends - myself included), some soya custard, manuka honey and real butter.<br />Next shelf down - dried fruit, nuts and seeds galore (by the look of it another half-pack of icing sugar too. Clearly stockpiling icing sugar is a family trait - I think I have 3 boxes in my cupboard).<br />Bottom shelf - muddy allotment potatoes, cartons of juice, some vintage rice crispies that Mini-M hasn't noticed are possibly slightly stale, and some free-from strawberry macaroon slices.<br />In the door there's an assortment of spices, vinegars, oils and sauces, plus a bit tub of muesli just out of the shot.<br /><br />Indeed one of the bottles on the top shelf is some rosehip syrup which I used today to make some cake with - however since I've not taken a picture of it yet, that'll have to wait until another post - if it's any good.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-12-28493df211-large-image-0003.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-12-28-image-0001.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br />
