Now that I'm officially on holiday, I am catching up on a blogging backlog, still in my PJs whilst Mini-M is having a morning nap. Of course, she will probably decide it is time to wake up in about three minutes, before I get anywhere close to the end of this post, let alone onto the next, and I'm now wasting time writing rubbish that could be recipe words - I'll never learn! Onwards...<br /><div><br /></div><div>The December <a href="http://fussfreeflavours.com/breakfast-club/">Breakfast Club</a> challenge theme was Bread, and was hosted by <a href="http://krithiskitchen.blogspot.com/2011/11/guest-hosting-breakfast-club-17-theme.html">Krithi's Kitchen</a>. We were challenged to either make bread for breakfast, or use bread in a breakfast dish. I went for the former.</div><div><br /></div><div>This challenge coincided with a surfeit of bananas. Our veg box banana allocation is usually reserved for Mini-M who is a banana fiend, however she was on a bit of a food strike a few weeks ago, so suddenly there were three rather sad bananas in the fruit dish.</div><div><br /></div><div>In my epic 'Recipes' bookmarks folder, I had this one from <a href="http://veganbaking.net/">veganbaking.net</a> for <a href="http://www.veganbaking.net/vegan-recipes/breads-and-muffins/yeasted-banana-bread.html">Yeasted Banana Bread</a>. It's for proper bready bread, with yeast, rather than banana cakey bread, with bicarbonate of soda or SR flour.</div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>For once, I didn't have to de-dairy it, which meant it went into the oven without the familiar will it / wont it work feeling. Of course it did!</div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VMimQMejI_c/TvRc30vseXI/AAAAAAAACIY/bVkB-17Gkkc/s1600/13122011096.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VMimQMejI_c/TvRc30vseXI/AAAAAAAACIY/bVkB-17Gkkc/s400/13122011096.JPG" width="400" /></a></div></div><div>And for once my substitution list was low - so I'm not going to post the recipe, just direct you to the original. Where it called for 'non dairy milk' I used oat milk, and instead of canola oil I used sunflower, but that was it. No weirdness!</div><div><br /></div><div>The recipe is easy to make, and quick, in that there isn't much measuring, mixing or kneading involved, BUT slooooooow in that there is a lot of rising time. Not a good 'bread in a hurry' recipe, but a very good 'delicious warm bread without very much effort' recipe.</div><div><br /></div><div>It was sweet and banana-y but not too sweet - just right for breakfast. It toasted well, and got top marks from both me and Mr E. I don't think any of it even made it into Mini-M's mouth, but it throws very well, &nbsp;particularly the crusts, which can easily clear the length of the living room.</div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z_MMS19kjWs/TvRc9lU3WaI/AAAAAAAACIg/dHT_KAEOBTk/s1600/102_0015.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z_MMS19kjWs/TvRc9lU3WaI/AAAAAAAACIg/dHT_KAEOBTk/s400/102_0015.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I have to apologise also for the shocking photographs - this was made during the brief no-camera spell, when my old one gave up the ghost once and for all, and my new one hadn't arrived.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://fussfreeflavours.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Breakfast-Club-logo.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://fussfreeflavours.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Breakfast-Club-logo.gif" style="cursor: move;" /></a></div></div>
