It's my last daily photo of 2013. I've decided I'm not doing it in 2014. Now that I'm working full time, rather than part time, there are far fewer interesting things to take photos of!<br /><br />So I shall sign off from the photos with this one, of a poster made by Mr E and Mini-M, for a missing furby. We found it in the street and put it through the wash. Mini-M thought very altruistically that its owner might be sad, but is also secretly hoping they don't see the poster and phone to claim itâ€¦<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-12-31-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-12-31-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />
