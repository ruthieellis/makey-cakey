Last year, I took a photo every day, and posted a weekly roundup. Although it was fun, I didn't want the photographic pressure of doing it for another year - plus there's only so many emergency views out of the window at 11pm that folk want to see!<br /><br />But Mr E was keen to continue to take over the daily photo baton, and has been diligently snapping and uploading since the beginning of January.<br /><br />Here's his first month as an embedded Flick slide show (fingers crossed the technology works!)<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="300" width="400"> <param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjonoellis%2Ftags%2Fjanuary%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjonoellis%2Ftags%2Fjanuary%2F&user_id=10849339@N00&tags=january&jump_to=&start_index=">  </param><param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=109615">  </param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true">  </param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=109615" allowFullScreen="true" flashvars="offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjonoellis%2Ftags%2Fjanuary%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fjonoellis%2Ftags%2Fjanuary%2F&user_id=10849339@N00&tags=january&jump_to=&start_index=" width="400" height="300"></embed></object><br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">The order has gone a little bit non-chronological - I'll work on that for February, and if anyone is really eagle eyed, they'll spot a few of a snowy Arthur's Seat right at the end... from 2005, but also tagged with January in Mr E's photo stream, so thrown in for good measure!</div></div>
