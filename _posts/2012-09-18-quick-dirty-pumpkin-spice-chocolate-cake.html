Last week, <a href="http://www.belleaukitchen.com/">Dom at Belleau Kitchen</a> posted sophisticated and delicious looking <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-09-1823a066fe-large-image-0001.html">Pumpkin Cake with Chestnut Cream and Almond Meringue Topping</a>.<br /><br />I had a tin of pumpkin puree in the cupboard, courtesy of my fantastic 30th birthday present from Mr E, (which will be the subject of another yet-to-be-written blog post), and as usual cake wasn't far from my mind, but without quite the time required to create a nutty, pumkinny, merninguey masterpiece. (Yes, yes, I know that they're not really adjectives... but I'm using them anyway!).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-09-182ec13de1-large-image-0002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-09-18-image-0000.JPG" width="267" /></a></div><br />So at the opposite end of the sophistication spectrum, here is my pumpkin cake offering... baking purists look away now!<br /><b><br /></b><b>Quick and Dirty Pumpkin Spice Chocolate Cake</b> (serves 10)<br /><br /><ul><li>1 box of marble cake mix - making it both quick and dirty!</li><li>1 400g tin of solid pack pumpkin puree (unsweetened)</li><li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li><li>1 egg</li></ul>Ignore the instructions on the cake box.<br />Preheat the oven to 180C (160C fan).<br />Grease and base line a 9" round cake tin.<br />Instead of adding the oil, water and eggs as specified on the cake box, add 1 egg, the pumpkin puree and cinnamon and beat until well combined.<br />Put most of the mix into the tin, keeping back about 1/2 a cup of the mixture, then adding the chocolate flavouring and a tbsp of water.<br />If you can't find a marble cake mix, use plain vanilla, and add 2 tbsp cocoa powder and 1 tbsp water to the remaining mix.<br />Dollop the chocolate mixture on top and swirl around a bit, then level.<br />Bake for around 30 mins until cooked.<br />Cool in the tin for 5 mins then turn out onto a wire rack.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-09-183aac6aad-large-image-0003.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-09-18-image-0001.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />I used a box of Betty Crocker Marble Cake mix, which happens to be dairy free. I topped it with some chocolate icing, made with dairy free margarine, icing sugar and melted dark chocolate.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></div>The pumpkin makes the cake really moist - I was surprised how nice this was, since it is primarily packet cake - it doesn't taste weird and chemical. If you want a chocolate pumpkin fix in a hurry, the I wholeheartedly recommend it!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-09-185862224b-large-image-0004.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-09-18-image-0002.JPG" width="400" /></a></div>
