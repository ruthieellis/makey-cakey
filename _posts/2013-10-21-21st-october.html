Went to ASDA to buy emergency nappies. Space was tight. Whilst getting out of car VERY carefully and gently, touched door of next car with mine. Looked - no damage. Guy was in car, and by this point banging on window. Did an apologetic wave. Man starts swearing, shouting, tooting horn etc. Decide not to hang about and disappear into ASDA. Come out 10 mins later to discover he has gone, having ripped off our fuel cover cap and air valve cover, (and presumably taken them with him, since I couldn't find them lying anywhere). At least I remembered the nappies...<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-10-21-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-10-21-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div>!<br /><br />
