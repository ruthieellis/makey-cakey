I can't quite believe how quickly this week has zoomed past, and indeed the whole second half of this year. In fact, I'm sure it's actually only mid-August. Mini-M's 1st birthday seems only a coupe of weeks ago, but she's now almost 17 months old, and what a happy, chatty, kamikaze mountaineering little lady she is turning into! During yesterday's stormy weather, we did some unofficial scientific testing, and concluded she now has a vocabulary of about 50 words or sounds, and understands a whole lot more. New additions today include ham, teddy and snot. Nothing if not varied.<br /><br />So on to the pictures - it's been a week with lots of cheesy grins. Mini-M is turning into a bit of a diva in front of the camera, to the extent that she now picks it up, says cheese (which sounds like "shzzzzz") and waves it in my direction, whilst grinning from ear to ear. She's going to be disappointed come 2012 when my daily photo challenge finishes!<br /><br /><b>Saturday 3rd December</b><br />Mini-M looking very pleased with her new toy...
