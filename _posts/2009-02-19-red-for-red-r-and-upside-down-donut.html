Well, somehow despite my enthusiasm for the concept of writing a blog of all my making and caking exploits, life has got in the way a bit! Given how hectic things have been, I've managed to make or bake quite a few bits and pieces, so will try to get them all posted about soon!<div>On Friday 13<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">th</span> (seemed to pass of without too much bad luck...) it was 'Red for <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">RedR</span>' day at work. <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">RedR</span> is an engineering relief charity - you can get more info at <a href="http://www.redr.org/">http://www.redr.org</a>.</div><div>So as well as donning a red jumper for the day I thought I'd do a wee bit of red-themed baking to finish off the week on a sugar high. I did some '<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">RedR</span>' biscuits and had way too much fun with the red writing icing ;o) then to make sure there was enough to go round, rustled up some cupcakes with cherries on top.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SZ3SKDpNFzI/AAAAAAAAAGE/ChjtzhvJiRE/s1600-h/100_2325.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"> </a><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SZ3SKDpNFzI/AAAAAAAAAGE/ChjtzhvJiRE/s1600-h/100_2325.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 179px; height: 239px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SZ3SKDpNFzI/AAAAAAAAAGE/ChjtzhvJiRE/s320/100_2325.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5304627006330967858" border="0" /></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SZ3SKDpNFzI/AAAAAAAAAGE/ChjtzhvJiRE/s1600-h/100_2325.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"> </a><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SZ3SklC6IeI/AAAAAAAAAGM/EKI-MzIxSks/s1600-h/100_2331.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 220px; height: 165px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SZ3SklC6IeI/AAAAAAAAAGM/EKI-MzIxSks/s320/100_2331.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5304627461973746146" border="0" /></a><br /></div><br />Another recent baking discovery I'm particularly proud of can probably best be described as upside down doughnut muffins. A wee while ago I got a mini silicone donut/<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">dariole</span> pan and was waiting for some inspiration to strike as to what to do with it. I actually went hunting for baked doughnut recipes, but after failing to find one that didn't involve yeast (which I didn't have) and noticing I had some squashy bananas looking like they needed using up, the end result being treacly banana and ginger upside down muffins with a hole in them. They were nice, but that wasn't the inspirational bit - that came when pondering the little hole in the middle of the muffin, and thinking that it was an ideal little pocket for a secret stash of icing (or jam would work too). So I mixed up some lemon icing and drizzled into the holes and all over the top, and even if I do say it myself, the end result was fab - an experiment that will definitely be being repeated!<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SZ3VcI3DV8I/AAAAAAAAAGU/d5wT1ghussw/s1600-h/100_2084.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 159px; height: 119px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SZ3VcI3DV8I/AAAAAAAAAGU/d5wT1ghussw/s320/100_2084.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5304630615503755202" border="0" /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SZ3V4Avv-CI/AAAAAAAAAGc/AMv0aj3L5E0/s1600-h/100_2086.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"> <img style="cursor: pointer; width: 159px; height: 119px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SZ3V4Avv-CI/AAAAAAAAAGc/AMv0aj3L5E0/s320/100_2086.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5304631094361978914" border="0" /></a></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SZ3WaY8LTvI/AAAAAAAAAGk/xcnnDDSClUA/s1600-h/100_2093.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/SZ3WaY8LTvI/AAAAAAAAAGk/xcnnDDSClUA/s320/100_2093.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5304631684972105458" border="0" /></a></div>
