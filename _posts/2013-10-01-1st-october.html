Day off today after a busy few weeks meant I had some flexi time to use. One of my jobs - going to drop off Mini-M's painting at the new Tumbles Soft Play at Portobello - it was a winning entry in the draw to win VIP tickets to the opening of the centre of Friday - that's what Mini-M and Mr E will be doing whilst I'm at work!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-10-01-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-10-01-image-0000.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>
