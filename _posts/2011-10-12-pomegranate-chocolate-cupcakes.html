I love pomegranates. They remind me of being a kid, and wintry evenings, and sticky fingers, and total absorption in picking out all the little bits (which I recently discovered are called arils - who knew!). And to be honest, that's normally how I would still eat them. But I got a pack of four from the supermarket the other day, and decided that gave me enough for some cooking experimentation, as well as enjoying on their sticky, jewelly lovely own.<br /><br />So here are my pomegranate and chocolate cupcakes. Sweet and delicious with little pops of pomegranatey goodness.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b8Kr70nK1To/TpS8gjH9nrI/AAAAAAAABcg/Wcp6180JIAQ/s1600/101_0457.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b8Kr70nK1To/TpS8gjH9nrI/AAAAAAAABcg/Wcp6180JIAQ/s400/101_0457.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Pomegranate &amp; Chocolate Cupcakes</b> (makes 10-12)<br /><br /><ul><li>100g Self Raising Flour</li><li>100g Sugar (Granulated is fine, caster is better)</li><li>100g Dairy Free Margarine</li><li>2 eggs, beaten</li><li>25g grated dark chocolate (70%, dairy free)</li><li>50g pomegranate</li></ul><br />Preheat the oven to 180C (170C fan)<br />Line a 12 hole bun tin with paper cases.<br />Cream the margarine and sugar together, then gradually add the eggs, adding about 1tbsp flour with them to stop the mixture curdling.<br />Sieve in the flour and mix until combined.<br />Add the pomegranate and dark chocolate and give it a quick mix to distribute them evenly through the batter.<br />Divide between the prepared paper cases, and bake for about 15 mins until they are risen and golden and slightly springy to the touch.<br />Remove from the tin and cool on a wire rack.<br /><br />I didn't ice these - I'm a bit of a fan of plain cake, but I'm sure they would be lovely iced. They were delicious "naked" and also kept really well in an airtight box - the bits of pomegranate stopped them from drying out.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ByDeOVcFHiI/TpS8cyAHivI/AAAAAAAABcY/GBgHC99FkIw/s1600/101_0456.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ByDeOVcFHiI/TpS8cyAHivI/AAAAAAAABcY/GBgHC99FkIw/s400/101_0456.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br />Another on the make-again list.
