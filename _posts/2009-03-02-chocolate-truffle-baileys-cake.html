Just a quick post of a cake I made for my brother's girlfriend's welcome back to edinburgh party.<br /><div>It is the most ridiculously chocolately concoction with only 4 ingredients.... chocolate, double cream, shortcake biscuits and Baileys. Finished cake had about 800g of chocolate and a pint of cream, so definitely not for the health-conscious, but on the other hand, it fed a crown generously with plenty of leftovers. I topped it off with some mini marshmallows that were sprinkled on before it set, and white chocolate stars. Ideally these would have been embedded into it stickying up, but due to the logistics of transporting it across Edinburgh in a taxi I decided to go for the safe option and scatter them over the top on arrival.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/Saw9iftT6rI/AAAAAAAAAHk/fhL_dclhbEg/s1600-h/100_2365.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5308685723599366834" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2009-03-02-image-0000.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; height: 300px; width: 400px;" /></a></div>
