Safari Park! We had a super day at Blair Drummond with team Head.<br />I have to say that even in the car, I was a bit scared of the lions - they were so close to the road. And I'm REALLY glad that as we were driving round the rhinos were in their indoor pen!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-10-06-linked-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-10-06-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />
