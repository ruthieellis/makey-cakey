This year we've made a LOT of jam. I say we, since Mr E was fully involved in the jam making process - be it sterilising, stirring, boiling, labelling, peeling, coring, chopping etc. At one point I think there were about 60 jars of it in our spare room, most of which were subsequently given as Christmas gifts.<div><br /></div><div>How many jam recipe are there on my blog - very few - likewise chutney. Whilst this is called jam, it is probably almost a chutney. So I shall being to redress the lack of preserve recipes with this one.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kmoeDNFdkvA/Us8cteEAXRI/AAAAAAAAHks/cTAr_peXT04/s1600/DSC02791.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kmoeDNFdkvA/Us8cteEAXRI/AAAAAAAAHks/cTAr_peXT04/s1600/DSC02791.JPG" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><div></div><div><br /></div><div>I made a single jar of this jam as part of Mr E's Christmas present. I was intrigued by the concept, but slightly sceptical whether or not it would work - and it did - deliciously.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fARB638c7Ok/Us8cg71S6QI/AAAAAAAAHkc/FGZT-0_uSYs/s1600/DSC02741.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fARB638c7Ok/Us8cg71S6QI/AAAAAAAAHkc/FGZT-0_uSYs/s1600/DSC02741.JPG" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><div></div><div><br /></div><div>My plan had been to use a bottle of Mr E's homebrew stout, however he was a bit nervous of the quality, since he wasn't in the dark as to what I was planning for it, so instead he bought me a bottle of Guinness Foreign Extra Stout. I found some cinnamon maple cure bacon, and used that to give extra flavour, but you could just use regular bacon and add some spice yourself.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cCRYOAdRmRQ/Us8csEnKG0I/AAAAAAAAHkk/MWtvTC7f3UY/s1600/DSC02790.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cCRYOAdRmRQ/Us8csEnKG0I/AAAAAAAAHkk/MWtvTC7f3UY/s1600/DSC02790.JPG" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><div></div><div><br /></div><div>My inspiration came from <a href="http://thebeeroness.com/">The Beeroness</a>&nbsp;- her recipe for <a href="http://thebeeroness.com/2012/05/22/beer-bacon-jam/">Beer and Bacon Jam</a> to be specific. Honestly, there are so many amazing recipes for cooking with beer on her site - beer inspiration!</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T0T3r6sDK5g/Us8cZR6TpCI/AAAAAAAAHkM/_YTUO3o2Z3Q/s1600/DSC02785.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T0T3r6sDK5g/Us8cZR6TpCI/AAAAAAAAHkM/_YTUO3o2Z3Q/s1600/DSC02785.jpg" height="400" width="265" /></a></div><div></div><div><br /></div><div>So without further ado, here is my take:</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Maple Bacon &amp; Stout Jam</b> (makes 1x 400g jar)</div><div><ul><li>240g maple cure bacon</li><li>1 tsp olive oil</li><li>1 medium onion</li><li>1 clove of garlic, peeled but left whole</li><li>1 cup of stout (that's 1x 330ml bottle, with a little left to sup as you go!)</li><li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li><li>1/2 cup dark brown sugar</li><li>1 tbsp golden syrup</li></ul></div><div>Heat the oil in a medium pan.&nbsp;</div><div>Chop the bacon into pieces and fry over a medium heat until browned.&nbsp;</div><div>Finely chop the onion, then add to the pan with the garlic clove.&nbsp;</div><div>Sautee for a few more minutes until the onion is softened.&nbsp;</div><div>Add the beer, vinegar, sugar and syrup and simmer for around half an hour.</div><div>Remove from the heat, take out the garlic clove and blitz with a hand blender to a chunky texture.</div><div>Return to the heat and continue to simmer until syrupy and thickened, then pour into a clean, warm, sterilised jar.</div><div>Seal and allow to cool, then keep in the fridge, where it will keep for around a month.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EiMUnyRNDCU/Us8cbL9NoNI/AAAAAAAAHkU/zZ2LI3xprmU/s1600/DSC02788.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EiMUnyRNDCU/Us8cbL9NoNI/AAAAAAAAHkU/zZ2LI3xprmU/s1600/DSC02788.JPG" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><div></div><div><br /></div><div>So how does it taste - sweet, savour, beer-y, bacon-y and very tasty based on the speed at which the jar disappeared! It has been sampled in a variety of foils, including (but not limited to)â€¦ straight from the spoon, on toast, on potato scones, on cheese and crackers, and controversially - on a bacon sandwich!</div>
