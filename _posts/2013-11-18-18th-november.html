Mini-M has been telling us - normally as an alternative to going to sleep at the end of the day - that she has a sore tummy. When we ask her how long it has been sore for she says all the time. But it is never mentioned at any point during the day, she's happy and full of beans and doesn't seem in any obvious pain. So I'm leaning towards it being a bedtime delaying tactic. However…. we're having a happy/say tummy chart for a while just in case. Towards the end of the day Mini-M has to draw a happy or a sad face depending on how her tummy has been feeling. Today it was apparently sad - with tear because there is generally a fair amount of melodrama about life at the moment. Said whilst smiling… I'm fairly sure that toddlers are designed to cause maximum parent confuzzlement!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-11-18-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-11-18-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />
