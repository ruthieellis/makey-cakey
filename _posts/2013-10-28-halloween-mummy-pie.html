Not so much a recipe, but a set of instructions to make a bandaged-mummy-style pie. If Halloween on the horizon isn't a good excuse for such pastry shenanigans, then I don't know when is!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dqpSvD2x9ec/Um7mFuThVUI/AAAAAAAAG_Y/zrHWSyCOSNA/s1600/DSC02198.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dqpSvD2x9ec/Um7mFuThVUI/AAAAAAAAG_Y/zrHWSyCOSNA/s400/DSC02198.jpg" width="265" /></a></div><br />The ingredients you will need are...<br /><br /><b>Mummy Plait Pie</b> (serves 4-6)<br /><ul><li>1 sheet ready rolled puff pastry (lots are dairy free)</li><li>Your filling of choice (it should be cooked already, i.e. no raw meat, and not too wet, otherwise your Mummy will ooze all over the tray)</li><li>1 egg, beaten to glaze</li></ul>Preheat the oven to 200C.<br />Unroll the pastry sheet and place onto your baking tray. Mine was handily rolled in parchment that was oven safe, so I just left it on that to minimise tray cleaning.<br />Next you need to imagine your filling going long-ways down the middle of your pastry, in a line about 3 inches wide. Cut strips from the outside edges into where you estimate the edge of your filling will end up.<br />Dollop your filling down the middle.<br />Starting at one end, fold left then right, overlapping slightly each time. You're trying to make it look superficially like a plait without the third strand being there.<br />I started going at too steep and angle, so had to switch ends - but lets face it, mummy bandages are unlikely to be that neat and pristine!<br />Once you've finished wrapping, brush all over with the beaten egg. A helpful tip - if you've got some gaps visible, give them a good coating of egg, and it will help seal them and minimise the filling leaking out.<br />Bake for about 25 mins until the pastry is puffed and golden.<br />Enjoy and feel spooky!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-55k2OIfVj8I/Um7mLAjHqzI/AAAAAAAAG_g/6z35yEa3HZE/s1600/DSC02199.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-55k2OIfVj8I/Um7mLAjHqzI/AAAAAAAAG_g/6z35yEa3HZE/s400/DSC02199.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />I filled ours with a tomato, lamb, cumin, couscous and sauerkraut mixture (randomly using things up in the kitchen, but a tasty result thankfully). This would work with any filling really - sweet or savoury. Thick apple compote would make a delicious dessert. Something cheesy and beetroot would cut and look like oozy guts.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rEUi1051dL8/Um7mtlDZhAI/AAAAAAAAG_o/0BTVeZvaDF4/s1600/2013-10-24+17.13.26.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rEUi1051dL8/Um7mtlDZhAI/AAAAAAAAG_o/0BTVeZvaDF4/s400/2013-10-24+17.13.26.jpg" width="300" /></a></div>
