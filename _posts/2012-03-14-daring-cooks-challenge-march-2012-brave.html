<a href="http://thedaringkitchen.com/">The March, 2012 Daring Cooks' Challenge</a> was hosted by Carol a/k/a Poisonive - and she challenged us all to learn the art of Braising! Carol focused on Michael Ruhlman's technique and shared with us some of his expertise from his book "Ruhlman's Twenty".<br />My braising recipe choice was dictated by the veg box, and what needed using up: potatoes! After some searching, I came across a recipe for braised sausages and potatoes on the BBC website, by Rick Stein and originally from the Mediterranean Escapes Series, titled "<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/fennelsausagesbraise_86774">Fennel Sausages Braised with Lemony Potatoes and Bay Leaves</a>". I did have some sausages in the freezer, so it seemed like a winner!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HZuwpfzw8hY/T1_KyIhg-bI/AAAAAAAAClQ/L45DodtdHWw/s1600/13032012277.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HZuwpfzw8hY/T1_KyIhg-bI/AAAAAAAAClQ/L45DodtdHWw/s400/13032012277.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />After digging out the sausages, I discovered they were of the spicy pepper chorizo style variety, with no fennel in sight - oh, and as usual I didn't have a lemon!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>So I went with what I had and used the same method, reducing the quantities a bit too, so that there weren't too many leftovers for tomorrow.<br /><br /><b>Braised Spicy Sausage and Potatoes </b>(Serves 3)<br /><br /><ul><li>6 pork 'chorizo style' sausages (about 350-400g in total) - mine had a lot of red pepper and garlic in them, as well as spices</li><li>1 medium onion</li><li>1 tbsp olive oil</li><li>500-600g waxy potatoes</li><li>150ml water</li><li>4 dried bay leaves</li><li>1 tbsp bottled lemon juice</li><li>1 tbsp fresh parsley chopped</li></ul><br />Preheat the oven to 180C<br />In an oven and hob proof casserole dish with a lid, heat the oil and then brown the sausages for a few minutes.<br />Finely slice the onion and add it to the sausages and cook until translucent.<br />Peel and chunk the potatoes - mine we fairly small, so I left most in quarters. Don't cut them too small or they will get overcooked and soupy.<br />Add the potatoes, water, lemon juice and bay leaves.<br />Cover with the lid and pop in the oven for about 30-40 minutes.<br />Remove the lid and return to the oven for another 5 minutes to colour.<br />Stir through the fresh parsley just before serving.<br />Delicious! We ate ours with coleslaw.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JJ8EDRtD2Gc/T1_K4BrLhjI/AAAAAAAAClg/nYiDZgHBQlU/s1600/13032012279.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JJ8EDRtD2Gc/T1_K4BrLhjI/AAAAAAAAClg/nYiDZgHBQlU/s400/13032012279.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />Would I make it again - yes! It's a lower hassle variation on Bangers and Mash! If your sausages aren't garlicky, then add a clove of garlic along with the onion. You could chuck in some other veg too - turnip, swede, carrot, parsnip - they'd all be lovely.<br /><br />Whilst searching for the sausage recipe, I stumbled across another one that took my fancy on the BBC website - this time a sweet braise - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/aromaticbraisedapric_11975">Aromatic Braised Apricots by Jane Sen</a>. I was intrigued and had everything to hand, so we had a doubly braised dinner tonight - main course and dessert!<br /><br />I had hoped that Mini-M would eat this - she absolutely adores dried apricots - but the melt down over main course meant that pudding didn't happen - so we'll have to wait until tomorrow to find out!<br /><br />I've scaled back Jane's recipe to serve 2-3 and tweaked it a little to incorporate more of a braising element, rather than just simmering.<br /><br /><b>Spiced Braised Apricots with Cashew Cream</b> (Serves 2-3)<br /><br /><ul><li>150gm dried apricots</li><li>2 cardamom pods</li><li>a generous pinch of ground cinnamon</li><li>1 heaped tsp of dairy free margarine</li><li>Water</li><li>80g cashew nuts</li><li>100ml apple juice</li></ul><br />Melt the margarine in a small saucepan then add the apricots, cardamom and cinnamon and stir for a few minutes until they are just starting to colour.<br />Add boiling water to cover and allow to simmer for about 30 minutes until the apricots are plump and the water has thickened into syrup. Add a little more water from time to time if necessary.<br />To make the cream, put the cashews in a food processor and blitz until finely ground. The smaller you can get the meal the smoother your cream will be. Mine was still fairly 'bitty' but it didn't bother us!<br />Scrape down the sides of the processor bowl, then put it back on at a low speed and gradually pour in the apple juice. Once it is all incorporated, whizz it up for another minute then chill until you're ready.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j0rr8_ElpqM/T1_K9ixtAiI/AAAAAAAAClw/eBdTagC8-T4/s1600/13032012281.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j0rr8_ElpqM/T1_K9ixtAiI/AAAAAAAAClw/eBdTagC8-T4/s400/13032012281.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />This is a dessert that is sweet, creamy, delicious, and has no added sugar! I am a convert to cashew cream too - so easy and so tasty.<br /><br />Thanks Carol for adding two new recipes to my arsenal!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
