So….. 27th September was supposed to be <a href="http://thedaringkitchen.com/">Daring Bakers</a>' posting day, HOWEVER I was a little bit preoccupied with this lot (or 50% of this lot, to be more precise!):<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-09-30-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-09-30-image-0000.jpg" height="400" width="265" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>All freshly baked by myself and my good friend Mrs H for an afternoon tea fundraiser in aid of <a href="http://www.buttleuk.org/">Buttle UK</a> which we hosted on the 28th.</div><div><br /></div><div>So I'm classing that as a very good excuse to my late posting (and possibly a topic for a future blog post in its own right).</div><div><br /></div><div>But for now, it's time for a virtual journey to the Czech Republic for some&nbsp;traditional sweet treats called koláče.</div><div><br /></div><div>Blog checking lines:</div><div>The September Daring Bakers' challenge was brought to us by Lucie from <a href="http://www.chezlucie.cz/">ChezLucie</a>. She challenged us to make a true Czech treat - Kolaches.</div><div><br /></div><div>She shared recipes for three different types of&nbsp;Koláčes - different variants of sweet enriched bread with fillings ranging from quark to poppy seeds and jam.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-09-30-image-0001.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-09-30-image-0001.jpeg" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><div></div><div><br /></div><div>I chose to make the Moravske Koláčes - a speciality from Moravia which are traditionally filled with two fillings: plum jam and quark, and topped with a streusel topping.</div><div><br /></div><div>As usual, I didn't have the right ingredients, and I was trying to make it low-dairy. Mini-M can have a little bit now, but not into the realm of quark-filled buns just yet! So I substituted thick coconut milk yoghurt (I used <a href="http://www.coyo.co.uk/">Coyo</a> plain) and homemade blackcurrant jam made by Granny E. I used regular milk but dairy-free margarine in the dough instead of butter.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-09-30-image-0002.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-09-30-image-0002.jpeg" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><div></div><div><br /></div><div>These buns were a roller coaster to make. Initial excitement, then abject despair when the dough refused to rise (probably not that surprising given the vintage of the yeast I used). However 3.5hours later, I decided just to bake them and see what happened, and lo and behold they rose - phew!</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-09-30-image-0003.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-09-30-image-0003.jpg" height="400" width="300" /></a></div><div></div><div><br /></div><div>The end result was delicious - Mini-M was smitten. They have now been reminisced about on more than one occasion since the eating, and are referred to as "proper buns" - as opposed to cupcake buns.</div><div><br /></div><div>There is an excellent and <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2014-09-30f04ae9e1-large-image-0008.pdf">comprehensive recipe available on the Daring Kitchen</a> which I'm not going to recreate here, but I do thoroughly recommend you try it out. They are fantastic, and I'll definitely be making them again. Although first I might have to give Jagodzianki a try - the&nbsp;Koláčes have brought back a taste for my favourite Polish bake - a sweet bread filled with blueberries - one of these from the corner shop was a lunchtime treat when I did my summer placement in Warsaw quite a few years ago now.</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-09-30-image-0004.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-09-30-image-0004.jpeg" height="265" width="400" /></a></div>
