Late again. This was supposed to be posted on Saturday, and it's now Monday.<br />We were away for the weekend with friends to the Isle of Arran, and I thought I had written a post and scheduled it to auto-post on the 27th. Turns out what I actually did was write about 2 sentences, and save it as a draft.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>So without further ado, I shall get on with it.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MY5VkegJY6M/UI799hrWwNI/AAAAAAAAD-4/Po5IXVqJsTI/s1600/IMGP5494.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-10-29-image-0000.JPG" width="267" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Rather flat Mille Feuille!</td></tr></tbody></table>Our October 2012 <a href="http://thedaringkitchen.com/">Daring Bakers</a>' challenge was hosted by Suz of <a href="http://serenelyfull.blogspot.co.uk/">Serenely Full</a>. Suz challenged us to not only tackle butter and flaky puff pastry, but then take it step further and create a sinful delicious Mille Feuille dessert with it!<br /><br />This challenge was, by all measures, a fairly unmitigated fail for me.<br /><br />I burned my first lot of pastry, and it was good only for christening our new food-waste recycling bin.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QICAXHpi4TI/UI79wuSINbI/AAAAAAAAD-o/1pLkEmG9hho/s1600/100_4296.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-10-29-image-0001.JPG" width="212" /></a></div><br /><br />I intended to fill it with strawberry marshmallow mousse, instead of pastry cream, and the mousse was made and setting up before I cremated the pastry, so we just ate it as it was. It was made with fresh strawberries, marshmallows and coconut milk and was lovely, although unphotogenic!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-er4Z0zQUOAk/UI79pfOMq-I/AAAAAAAAD-g/MFhNuF3V9pI/s1600/100_4294.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="265" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-10-29-image-0002.JPG" style="cursor: move;" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />For my second attempt I used some spare ready made puff pastry, which I know is a big cheat, just so that I could try to create something vaguely Mille Feuille-ish.<br />I then didn't put enough pastry cream in it, and then because it was already a fail, I didn't want to go to the effort of mixing up icing to adorn something so unimpressive, so I topped it with jam!<br /><br />On the plus side, I did manage to make a very tasty and effective dairy free pastry cream, or creme patisserie if you're feeling continental, using almond milk. So that's something!<br /><br /><b>Almond Pastry Cream</b><br /><br /><ul><li>500ml almond milk</li><li>50g icing sugar</li><li>50g cornflour</li><li>2 egg yolks</li><li>a few drops almond extract</li></ul><br />Put all of the ingredients in a small pan and blitz with a hand blender until completely smooth and mixed.<br />Slowly bring to a medium heat, stirring constantly, until the cream thickens.<br />Once it coats the back of a spoon and leaves a trail in the surface, remove from the heat.<br />Allow to cool slightly, then transfer to a bowl or tub.<br />Cover with a sheet of baking parchment on the surface to prevent it from forming a skin.<br />Chill for at least an hour before using, preferably over night.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IJ0hYE3GpQk/UI79343naBI/AAAAAAAAD-w/L3I0qxuPnDA/s1600/IMGP5492.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-10-29-image-0003.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">It's also good on crumble! <a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/super-crumble.html">Super crumble</a> to be precise!</td></tr></tbody></table>
