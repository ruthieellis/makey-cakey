<p dir=ltr>I've been a bit silent on the blogging front - my computer is poorly - so I'm writing this post from my phone!&#160; Please excuse a) brevity b) formatting c) lack of proper challenge logos etc because inserting them is beyond me.</p><p dir=ltr>For this month's random recipes challenge - hosted as always by<a href="http://belleaukitchen.com"> Dominic at Belleau Kitchen -</a> we were challenged to pick a book languishing on our shelves and give it a final whirl before dispatching it to the charity shop.</p><p dir=ltr>I chose the book "Apples For Jam" by Tess Kiros with a heavy heart.&#160; It's a gorgeous book and I was over the moon to discover it in a charity shop a while ago. But I have to confess I've not made anything else from it and it is a weighty tome, hence my decision to bid it a reluctant farewell.</p><p dir=ltr>The recipe I ended up with was thankfully super simple - good bread baked with honey, nuts, brown sugar and butter. I messed about with the ingredients and proportions but the essence is the same. We enjoyed it for pudding but it would make a fantastic breakfast treat.</p><p dir=ltr><b>Baked </b>honey &amp; nut bread (serves 4)</p><p dir=ltr>2 large thick slices of white crusty bread<br>50g runny honey<br>1 tbsp dark br<b>own soft </b>sugar<br>1 tbsp dairy free<b> </b>margarine<br>6 small Brazil nuts<br>12 small skin on almo<b>nds</b></p><p dir=ltr><b>Preheat</b> the ov<b>en</b><b> to </b><b>180C </b><b>and </b>line a baking tray with parchment. <br>Roughly chop the nuts<br>Melt the margarine then mix with the honey nuts and sugar<br>Spread the mixture evenly over the 2 slices<br>Bake for around 20 mins until crispy<br>Allow to cool slightly then enjoy whilst still warm.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"> <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-GwGwAbC-lCo/U4ULo2j_SuI/AAAAAAAAH14/SpQ9xN65aik/s1600/20140525_173546.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"> <img border="0" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-GwGwAbC-lCo/U4ULo2j_SuI/AAAAAAAAH14/SpQ9xN65aik/s640/20140525_173546.jpg"> </a> </div>
