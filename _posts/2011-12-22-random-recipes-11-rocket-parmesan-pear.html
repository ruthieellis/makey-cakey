December's Random Recipe Challenge - hosted by the ever ingenious Dom at Belleau Kitchen was to make a recipe from a cook book that you rarely use, then give it away to charity, (The book, not the cooking!) which was a lovely idea, and a welcome antidote to all the mince pie and Christmas cake type posts flying around. Not that they aren't delicious and lovely too, of course, but sometimes it's possible to get a bit Christmassed out. And of course, charity shops are always on the look out for donations, many with stock appeals at this time of year, so it's a win win situation!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vVhAMyQRmsA/TvOaZrGFUBI/AAAAAAAACH8/zWzHMzKCbfk/s1600/09122011079.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vVhAMyQRmsA/TvOaZrGFUBI/AAAAAAAACH8/zWzHMzKCbfk/s400/09122011079.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />My book was World Cuisine Italy (1) which I think may have come from a newspaper at some point in the past, but is a fairly substantial book that had languished unused and unloved on my cookbook shelf.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v4D3RE6e1rw/TvOahgsng6I/AAAAAAAACIE/nsLIdUtjCCw/s1600/100_0095.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v4D3RE6e1rw/TvOahgsng6I/AAAAAAAACIE/nsLIdUtjCCw/s320/100_0095.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />I asked my sister, the lovely Auntie L to choose me a random recipe, and she picked Rocket, Parmesan and Pear salad, or Insalata di Rucola, Parmigiano e Pera if we're going to be Italian about it.<br /><br />Since I'm still non-dairy, it immediately lost one of it's three key ingredients, and became Rocket and Pear Salad, which was thankfully still peppery, sweet, and tangy with a dressing of balsamic vinegar and olive oil.<br /><br />So yet again, not what I was supposed to make, but lovely all the same. Don't be scared of adding pears to your winter salads - they are fantastic - I am a convert!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bRsA9dInpVA/TvOamGGHUVI/AAAAAAAACIM/697TWbDgRZ8/s1600/randomrecipes2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bRsA9dInpVA/TvOamGGHUVI/AAAAAAAACIM/697TWbDgRZ8/s1600/randomrecipes2.jpg" /></a></div><br />
