It's Halloween today - how do I know this? Because at the centre where I was teaching my music classes this morning there were kids in fancy dress - vampires, bats, devils... Quite a lot of them too. At 10am on a Saturday morning. Which is really quite keen in my book! Anyway, I'm off to a Halloween party tonight - two in fact and I thought it was a good excuse to go in for some silly baking to take along. After a trawl of the web for ideas, I was taken by the <a href="http://bakingbites.com/2007/10/vampire-cupcakes/">Vampire Cupcakes on Baking Bites</a>. And, lo, here are my fang-tastic creations...<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/Suxj0a-ggBI/AAAAAAAAAOg/HCTHTvVzO_M/s1600-h/100_4475.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2009-10-31-image-0000.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5398799805556228114" border="0" /></a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/Suxj0niUMlI/AAAAAAAAAOo/QiXA77rZw9M/s1600-h/100_4491.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2009-10-31-image-0001.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5398799808927642194" border="0" /></a>I love the fact that the 'blood' in the bottom picture is even slightly heart shaped :o)<br /><br />Since I like in Scotland and Corn Syrup and Cherry Pie Filling are not things that I generally have to hand or are easy to come by, I substituted some light Agave Syrup and used straight jam for the filling, so it's not quite as oozy as the original version. I also only had golden caster sugar, and forgot to put the water in to the icing, hence the fact that it's a slightly funny colour and a bit gritty!!!!! Ah well - all part of the learning process...
