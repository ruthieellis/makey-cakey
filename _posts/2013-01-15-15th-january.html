1st day at new job today - then epic toddler tantrums when I got home. It's been a recurring theme recently (the tantrums, not starting new jobs every day!), so 15 mins with a Sharpie and some brown wrapping paper and we now have 'Martha's Big Behaviour Chart' on the wall. The idea is that if there's good or bad behaviour, then that earns a tally mark on the chart, and the aim is to have more good than bad at the end of the week...<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-01-15-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-01-15-image-0000.jpg" width="480" /></a></div><br />
