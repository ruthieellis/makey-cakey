It's Halloween on Friday.<br />And for once I've managed to make something seasonal at least a few days in advance - wonders behold. On the other hand, I reversed into a bin when I was going out earlier - so you win some, you lose some…<br /><br />Here are a couple of easy Halloween themed treats.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-10-27-image-0000.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-10-27-image-0000.jpeg" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>First up - Franken-Biscuits</b><br /><br />I made 2 prototypes, and am going to let Mini-M loose creating her own Franken-Biscuit army later in the week. They use Lotus biscuits as the base which I found in the pound shop (are are dairy-free into the bargain) - just thought I should clarify that I did not raid the client biscuit cupboard at work, or save them up from coffee-shop visits for the purpose - that's a whole other level of forward planning!<br /><br />You will need:<br /><ul><li>Lotus biscuits (or other plain rectangular variety)</li><li>Green royal icing (I used royal icing powder, made up with lemon juice and a little green food colouring)</li><li>Raisins</li><li>A couple of squares of chocolate</li><li>Writing icing (I used yellow and red but you could use any)</li><li>A few jelly beans</li><li>A few strands of wholewheat spaghetti</li></ul>First cover the biscuits with the icing - it doesn't matter if it oozes off the sides - this isn't really about precision!<br />Next grate the chocolate and sprinkle over one end of the biscuits for Frankenstein's hair.<br />Use a raising for each eye and half a jelly bean for the nose and position to make the face.<br />Add the mouth with red writing icing, and eye dots in a light colour (I used yellow).<br />Snap off a piece of spaghetti a little wider than your biscuit and push half a raising onto each end to make the "bolt" and put on top of the biscuit then voila - you're done.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-10-27-image-0001.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-10-27-image-0001.jpeg" height="400" width="265" /></a></div><br />I had originally planned to use pretzels for the "bolts" with each end dipped in a little melted chocolate, but it turned out the pretzels in the cupboard weren't sticks but twists, which would have looked rather weird.<br /><br />So… onto the <b>Vampire Cupcakes</b> - <a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk/2009/10/vampire-fairy-cakes.html">I first posted these 5 years ago</a>!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-10-27-image-0002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-10-27-image-0002.JPG" height="400" width="400" /></a></div><br />But here's a recap…<br />You'll need some plain cupcakes, some very red jam and some 7-minute frosting.<br />After your cupcakes are cooled, take a small sharp knife and cut a cone out of the middle of each cake.<br />Cut the bottom of the cone off, leaving a little flat lid. Spoon jam into the hollowed out space then top with the little lid.<br />Cover with a layer of frosting, then use a toothpick to put some jammy fang-marks on the surface - done. Told you it was easy :-)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-10-27-image-0003.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-10-27-image-0003.JPG" height="400" width="400" /></a></div><br />So - when the time comes… Happy Halloween!<br /><br />I'm entering the Franken-Biscuits into Treat Petite, which is hosted alternately by <a href="http://www.cakeyboi.com/">Cakeyboi</a> and <a href="http://www.thebakingexplorer.com/">The Baking Explorer</a>, ever so slightly late but hopefully better than never! The theme for October, hosted by The Baking Explorer is "<a href="http://www.thebakingexplorer.com/2014/10/treat-petite-october.html">Trick or Treat</a>"<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-10-27-image-0004.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014-10-27-image-0004.png" height="214" width="320" /></a></div><br />
