After almost 11hrs at work (!) a lovely evening was spent catching up with a friend, with good food and good chat - just what was needed. As usual, no photos taken of any of the interesting parts of the day though - this was just as I was leaving to drive back to Leith from Currie.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-07-25-linked-image-0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/a2013-07-25-image-0000.jpg" width="300" /></a></div>
