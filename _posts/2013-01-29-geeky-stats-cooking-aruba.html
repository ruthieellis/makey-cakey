I'm back on my culinary tour of some of the lesser visited countries in the world - more specifically I'm trying to cook something from every country that I've not had a blog visitor from (assessed via the ever insightful Google Analytics).<br /><br />So far I've ticked off &nbsp;<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-01-29a75bd1fe-large-image-0000.html">Gibraltar</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-01-2968a6d101-large-image-0001.html">Georgia</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-01-29d7548a52-large-image-0002.html">the Isle of Man</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-01-2916cec96a-large-image-0003.html">Monaco</a>. Now it's Aruba.<br /><br />I made Pan Bati which are a traditional side dish of cornmeal pancakes flavoured with vanilla. Apparently they are often served with fish as a main course accompaniment, but we had them cut into fingers and dipped in fruity custard for pudding - a very untraditional (but toddler friendly) approach!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-01-29e0dc5e9b-large-image-0004.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-01-29-image-0000.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />The recipe <a href="http://www.visitaruba.com/aruba-recipes/pan-bati/">I found here</a> was a little vague... so I'm posting my own version here which are also dairy free. As well as pinning down a quantity for the sugar, I made the executive decision to use fine polenta: the recipe specified cornflour but from the picture I reckoned it actually meant cornmeal, rather than the white powdery stuff we call cornflour in the UK.<br /><br />I cooked half of the mixture using the quantities of flour and liquid specified in the recipe, but it was pretty sticky and even over a fairly low heat seemed very prone to burning long before the middles were cooked. There are three possible causes I can think of... 1) the addition of cornmeal, since I've never had this happen with regular pancakes 2) I used hazelnut milk, which I don't think I've tried to cook with in anything fried before or 3) the thermostat on the hob is wonky, so even though the dial was set to medium low, I was actually cooking on 'super heated'. I think (hope) that it's probably a combination of the first two!<br /><br />Halfway through cooking the mix, I decided to add some liquid - I went with about 1/4 cup extra of water which made a huge difference. They still burned easily, but cooked super quickly and were done in the middle at the same time as the outside.<br /><br />The taste of the pancakes is lovely and they are a little bit more dense than regular ones. I'm not sure I'd want to eat them with fish or other savoury dishes, but perhaps if there was only a smidge of sugar they'd be perfect. They would certainly mop up juices or gravy well!<br /><br /><b>Aruban Pan Bati</b> (Makes 12-18)<br /><br /><ul><li>2 cups plain flour</li><li>1 cup fine polenta</li><li>2 tsp baking powder</li><li>1/2 cup sugar</li><li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li><li>Pinch salt</li><li>1 cup non-dairy milk</li><li>1 egg</li><li>1/4 cup water (optional)</li></ul><br />Beat all of the ingredients together well until smooth, adding the extra water if it seems a bit too sticky.<br />Heat a heavy bottomed frying pan, grease it lightly, and drop in spoonfuls of the mixture.<br />Fry for a couple of minutes until small bubbles start to rise to the surface, then flip over and give them another minute or two on the other side.<br />Cool on wire rack in a tea-towel to stop them drying out.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2013-01-29848f96d3-large-image-0006.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-01-29-image-0001.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Enjoy as you will - toasted and buttered for breakfast, dipped in custard (a la Mini-M), or if you're feeling brave, as a side to an Aruban main course (whatever that may be!).<br /><br />And in case you're wondering... Aruba is an island in the Caribbean 17 miles north of Venezuela and 81 miles east of Colombia.
