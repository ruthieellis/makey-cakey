<div style="text-align: left;">It's been a busy weekend in the kitchen this weekend. And for once I remembered to take photos of at most of the results, which will hopefully keep me blogging through this week and beyond.</div><div><br /></div><div>First up is Mango Salsa with a "Secret Ingredient" which without further faff, I can reveal as <a href="http://www.bottlegreen.co.uk/Cordials">Bottlegreen</a><a href="http://www.bottlegreen.co.uk/Cordials"> Lemongrass and Ginger Cordial</a>. And as weird as that sounds, it really adds a lovely depth of flavour. Here's my recipe.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; "><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_feqj-aLoDF0/TU8Lw6UPL9I/AAAAAAAAAbI/ytVaryZuTl4/s400/100_6100.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5570684198996357074" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px; " /></span></div><div><br /></div><div>Mango Salsa (serves 3-4 with cold meats, or as a condiment)</div><div><br /></div><div>1 under-ripe mango</div><div>2 small or 1 large tomato (again, not too ripe works really well)</div><div>a 2 inch chunk of cucumber</div><div>A large handful of parsley (once chopped, about 2 generous tbsp)</div><div>1 tsp chopped chili (<a href="http://www.mydorot.com/Dorot-Chopped-Chili.aspx">I used a defrosted chili cube - a genius invention!</a>)</div><div>1 scant tbsp olive oil</div><div>1 scant tbsp white wine vinegar</div><div>1 scant tbsp lemon juice</div><div>1 scant tbsp ginger and lemongrass cordial</div><div><br /></div><div>Finely dice the mango, tomato and cucumber and put in a non-metallic bowl then finely chop the parsley and add along with the chili. Pour over the 4 dressing ingredients. Add a pinch of salt, mix well and leave for at least an hour before serving for the flavours to mingle. Best served at room temperature rather than straight from the fridge.</div><div><br /></div><div>We ate it with breaded lemon sole, wedges and broccoli, but it would go very well with grilled chicken, salmon, cold meats... anything really. It's a fab combination of spicy, sweet, tangy and crunchy, easy to make, and you aren't left smelling of onion and garlic for days - win!</div><div><br /></div>
