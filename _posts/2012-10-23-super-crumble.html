We had crumble after tea on Friday night at Mini'M's request. I have to confess I was a little confused at first, as the conversation went a little like this...<br /><div><br /></div><div>Mini-M: "Apple Crumble"</div><div>Me: "Pardon? Apple crumble? What about apple crumble"</div><div>Mini-M: "For pudding. My not liking apple crumble at nursery"</div><div>Me: "Did you have apple crumble at nursery and you didn't like it?"</div><div>Mini-M: "My liking apple crumble at home. After main course"</div><div>Me: "What is different about apple crumble at nursery that you didn't like" (thinking to myself, better suss it out, so that I don't make the same mistake...</div><div>Mini-M: "My not eating apple crumble at nursery. My having biscuit instead. Having dairy in it"</div><div><br /></div><div>Phew - mystery solved - no specific requirements, it seems in Mini-M's book any apple crumble is good, as long she's able to eat it!</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-10-2306c57777-large-image-0000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-10-23-image-0000.JPG" width="267" /></a></div><div></div><div><br /></div><div>The nursery she goes to are really great at making sure she doesn't eat dairy, and most of the meals are compatible, but every so often, there are things on the menu for everyone else that are off the menu for Mini-M.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>And once I'd established that the crumble bar was set fairly low, I decided that if I was going to pander to toddler-whim dessert making, I was going to make it as healthy as I possibly could. I'm calling it Super Crumble - since I managed to cram in blueberries, manuka honey, almonds and quinoa. There's no wheat, dairy or refined sugar in it. And it tastes really good - it got the wholehearted Mini-M seal of approval. (Which goes something like this "Mmmm nummy. Yum yum. Scrum Tum (laughs at her own rhyming witticism) my funny Mummy")</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-10-23418ddd0f-large-image-0001.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-10-23-image-0001.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div></div><div><br /></div><div><b>Super Crumble</b> (Serves 2 adults and 1 small person)</div><div>1 pear</div><div>1 apple</div><div>75g blueberries</div><div>1 tsp manuka honey</div><div>1 tbsp lemon juice</div><div>1 tbsp water</div><div>2 tbsp dairy free margarine</div><div>1 tbsp unrefined raw cane sugar&nbsp;</div><div>3 tbsp quinoa flakes</div><div><br /></div><div>Preheat the oven to 180C (160C fan)</div><div>Peel, core and chop the apple and pear into chunks.</div><div>Put in a microwaveable bowl and toss in the lemon juice and water.</div><div>Microwave for 2 mins until cooked</div><div>Stir in the blueberries and the manuka honey and tip the lot into a small casserole dish.</div><div>Chop the margarine into small pieces and put into a bowl along with the sugar, quinoa flakes and ground almonds.&nbsp;</div><div>Rub in until it resembles clumpy sandy breadcrumbs.</div><div>Sprinkle over the crumble and bake for about 20 mins until browned and golden.</div><div>Enjoy!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2012-10-238373d5f0-large-image-0002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-10-23-image-0002.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>I hate custard with a passion, so I had mine 'naked' (and indeed out of the casserole dish to minimise washing up, which confused Mini-M a little). She and Mr E ate it with some dairy free almond milk custard, but that's a post for another day!</div>
