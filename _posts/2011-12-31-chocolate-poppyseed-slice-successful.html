I'm a big fan of poppy seeds, particularly poppy seed cake (Makowiec) which I'm attributing to my Polish ancestry! I had good intentions of making some, but in the midst of Mini-M having some very festive pre-Christmas lurgy, I ran out of time. The tin of poppy seed filling just sat there on the counter, looking sadly at me every time I passed, saying 'bake me!' (Just to clarify, I don't actually talk to my ingredients, they don't actually talk to me, and I'm speaking metaphorically rather than madly!)<br /><br />So I did. In my head I envisaged a kind of poppy seed millionaires shortbread, without the caramel or chocolate topping. It pretty much worked out exactly like that, and better - I'll definitely be making it again. The shortbread bottom was based on this <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/68604/millionaires-shortbread">BBC Good Food Millionaire's Shortbread recipe</a>, and the topping by <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-12-3107c83072-large-image-0001.html">these Poppy Seed Cookies from Jar in the City</a>, which I de-nutted then chocolate-d up.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-12-311ea4aa46-large-image-0002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-12-31-image-0000.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />The result may not be exactly authentically Polish, but it tastes delicious so hopefully it's cultural transgression can be forgiven!<br /><br /><b>Chocolate Poppy seed Slice </b>(makes 1 tray)<br />For the base<br /><br /><ul><li>50g granulated sugar</li><li>140g dairy free margarine</li><li>175g plain flour</li><li>25g ground rice</li></ul><br />For the topping<br /><br /><ul><li>1x850g tin poppy seed filling</li><li>1 medium egg</li><li>1 tbsp plain flour</li><li>1 tbsp cocoa powder</li><li>1x 85g bar dark chocolate (mine was flavoured with ginger and mandarin)</li></ul><br />For the icing<br /><br /><ul><li>4 tbsp icing sugar</li><li>a little cold water</li></ul><br />Preheat the oven to 160C (Fan 140C) and grease a 9x13" rectangular brownie tin or similar.<br />Blitz all the base ingredients together in a food processor until it goes through the crumbly stage and starts clumping together.<br />Press the crumbly mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 25 minutes until golden.<br />Meanwhile make the filling by mixing the poppy seed filling, egg, plain flour and cocoa powder together well in a large bowl.<br />Melt the chocolate and stir it in to the poppy seed mixture.<br />Pour the topping over the cooked base, and spread out evenly.<br />Increase the oven temperature to 180C (Fan 160C) and bake for another 30 mins until slightly puffed and firm to the touch.<br />Allow to cool, then mix the icing sugar with a few teaspoons of cold water to a smooth consistency, and drizzle over the poppy seed layer with a teaspoon.<br />Allow to harden, then cut into squares to serve.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/large/2011-12-31f7685762-large-image-0003.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2011-12-31-image-0001.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Best of all, it's dairy free - enjoy!
